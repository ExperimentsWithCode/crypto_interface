What would you do if a guy names Sergey Hindenburger came here to shill his ethereum killer with 100 trillion TPS and his post would be titled stay poor?
yes, you would stay poor Deluded EOSfags are more deluded than the Arkies I lose hundreds or thousands of dollars on terrible scalping daytrades, which ALWAYS move against me and I panic and close the trade, then redo it when it moves again.

I can sit all evening and piss away $2000 of solid hodl coins, then go to bed exhausted from the stress.

How can I kill myself? STOP LOSS : NEVER >>9910172
>STOP LOSS : NEVER

I do stop out of the trades, but then I jump back into themand do the same thing again.

I wipe out a week of gains in one evening. If I had just sat on my alts all this year I'd have 5x what I do now, and would be retiring. >>9910121
rest in peace my dude >>9910121
Choose one week now. Force yourself to open no positions for that week, not even papertrading just to see if you can do it. Change your desktop background, block whatever sites you decide are convinient for that week. Whenever you visit a blocked site, drop to the ground and do 10 push ups. During that week, spend some time writing about how many trades a day you want to open and under what circumstances you would stop trading and consider what are your personal needs. >>9911109

I desperately want to but I'm balls deep in a low-volume shitcoin with a huge spread, that I can't get out of even if I tried
and my main hold (BNB) is coming to the end of its run.

I lost all the gains on it yesterday by trying to scalp. I bought high, sold low -EIGHT times in a few hours. at 1-2% loss each time >>9911109
this sounds good.
Have some fucking restraint anon.
Are you a slave to your addictions or will you rise above them!

When you have had your brake and feel like you can start trading again you will trade with a really small amount.

Maybe 1000 bucks or less. Now trade with that but only focus on the percentages not the actual money.
Write down every trade with all the details and the plan.
If you can trade that up to say 50% gain (without ever adding to the original money!).
Then perhaps you can try more money.

If you cant do the things above and you keep trading too much and losing too much money. You will have to face reality and quit trading because it is not for you. >>9911155
Trading is a meme anyway, I've known it for years. You make money by identifying medium term winners and sitting in them until they work out. As was my brilliant plan this year, sadly ruined due to my problems. >>9910259
Zoom out. Look at longer time scales so you can pick your entry points better, and be patient about when you enter. I use daily and hourly candles usually, and only go to shorter time scales when I am looking to exit. Also, don't buy pumps, they are pretty much designed to fuck you. Why would you be trying to play around with 1-10% gains?
what is the point?
I’d understand if it went up 30 - 40% in a day any you want to cash out your gains but seriously. >>9911182
I know all this, and I have planned excellent trades weeks or months in advance, but my execution is terrible since I found IDEX. I have been fixated upon total shitcoins like SNTR, PCL, etc and obsessed over them, huge fomo.
Distracting me from my solid gainers that just go up 10%/week reliably

I had a big stack and slow gainers were sufficient for me to Make It, but not any more. I've gambled away almost all of it. >>9910121
Same here... Fuck it is annoying >>9912231
I literally got bogged every single time I tried rrading the bart. I would put two orders so I could catch the bart in both directions, yet every single time this trade moved against me. Either it wicked to the other side before barting or it only half barted, or barted and then immediately reverse barted. Better luck next time!
Learn some self control 
You making retards like me money 

Also if you feeling stress trading probably not 4u >>9912246

We can't beat Them, mate. >>9910121

listen to this: https://vocaroo.com/i/s1Le8jFCGsJF 

Then stop trading. 
And go find something more useful to do. >>9912252
So what is your strategy then?

>>9912253
Yeah I found out the hard way. Lost almost 1000 to those trades >>9912267
>Lost almost 1000 to those trades

I am down abot $200,000

$30,000 in one week. >>9910121
each move against you increases the chances of getting a correction in favor of your position. just make sure you ladder your buys so you can take a few moves before you're all in. and adjust your take profit target. 

take your $2000 and only use $1000 to open a position. if it goes your way, great, take your profit. if it goes against you, add the other $1000 to your position at the extreme of the move against you. then take profit on the correction. maybe you'd wait for a 1% profit on your initial $1000 position, but you'll take %0.5 on your $2000 position, 0.25% if you get to a $4000 one, etc.

use stop losses to trail your profitable positions and let them run as far as they'll go. dont use them to get stopped out of improving your position at the first move against you. >>9912262

NEVER DAYTRADE COINS WITH UNDER 4000ETH DAILY VOLUME! NO, NO IT HAD 7000ETH DAILY VOLUME 3 WEEKS AGO ON LISTING PUMP. 

ONLY DAYTRADE COINS WITH STEADY 4K PLUS ETH VOLUME


WARNING:

>>>>>


ETH

DAILY VOLUME Here's how you fix your problem. Never short anything, ever. Never trade with leverage. Only by fast, sharp dips. Basically the only guarantee in trading is that fast/panic dips produce a bounce. Don't be greedy and take profits quickly. You can find tons of 5 to 20% trades with very low chances of losing (almost impossible if you go in with panic and layer down). Also, don't take trades because you are bored. Crypto is so boring lately - anyone taken up side hustles?

I was thinking, there are a lot of perverts on the internet who have no chances of making it with girls, so they buy used panties on leddit and such things. What if I got some women to milk themselves, willingly and for a pay of course, and I could sell that milk for profit? Surely there are people that would buy it, and it's not exactly illegal - you can always just claim it's for babies whose mothers can't breastfeed themselves.

The price for this stuff hovers between €30 - €60 a liter and the average woman can produce between 0.9 - 1.2 liters a day. That means the optimal milking setup could net you €2160 a month or €25920 a year. I bet you could easily double or triple those prices if the woman attached to the milk was attractive and thus a fetish object in her own right but these numbers are purely based on bulk raw milk. If we assume you set up your shop in Bulgaria to benefit from the cheapest cost of living that can be had in Europe, coupled with the reasonably attractive nature of slavs when compared to la creaturas, niggers and chinks you be set back around €1000 a month for a food and housing setup that could easily fit 5 producing women and have yourself living like a king (if you want to live with them, that is)

Does anyone have any experience with this? Am I going to make it? What I am wondering is, would I be able to oversee production? Like the way Trump got backstage in the dressing room of the Miss Teen Universe, can I inspect my milk operations?

It's all about the benefits haha Rory is a cuck and Chainlink is a failure amexfag was right, 22 pennies for 1 link. 60 pennies not long ago >>9908506
Pinkies BTFO God it pains me that men are desperate enough to cuck themselves with single mothers especially if the kids are half black; the women gives some semblance of "love" so the beta male can look after her and her kid when deep down inside she doesn't give a shit about the beta male just as a meal ticket because males are born providers for their own offspring. >>9908541

dude is that kid bald already? There are times when I think -- well, biz is kind of crazy, no holds barred, but it's free and open culture makes it the best place for up to date info -- there's no place like it.

Then there are times -- like now -- when I think, the most pathetic pieces of shit post on this board. You guys are making fun of an innocent, cute little kid. I seriously, seriously, seriously, wish I could be in the same room with at least one of you. Because I would seriously, seriously, seriously, kick the fucking shit out of you. Like no joking, I would punch you in the face till you were unconscious. You fucking disgusting pieces of shit. Make your stupid jokes about Sergey and big macs, and whatever, but keep that little kid out of it. >>9909392
You are dumb, it has nothing to do with the child and everything to do with the likely poor life choices the mother made and is pushing them on to her new cuck husband. >>9909392
You have to go back >>9909327 >>9909327

That's the best you can come up with you stupid sack of shit? Repeating the same stupid fucking line that has been said to you a millions times on this board since you first bought TRON because you were sure it was going to moon. Get the fuck out of here you utter piece of shit. >>9909413
This is the stupidest fucking thing anyone has ever said. Like, as in, report yourself to an emergency room because your brain is so fucking degraded it's not going to be able to keep your lungs working. On second thought, don't, because you will be doing the world a favor by fucking off and dying. 

You are a piece of shit. you have no fucking idea what "life choices" this woman made and you are in no position to judge them. The life choices you have made likely include being a worthless piece of shit who has done nothing ever to make the world a better place.

Make your stupid fucking jokes but keep this kid out of it. Shut your fucking mouth. >>9909457
>>9909467
Oh, look. Looks like we have a SEETHING cuck here who settled down for a white roastie with a niglet kid. >>9908541

No fucktwit. I am getting upset about people making jokes about a little kids. It doesn't matter you complete fucking brainlet that it is on 4chan. 

What is fucking pathetic is that you think it is cool to make fun of a little kid, or you think it is cool that some "cuck" is getting pissed about it. Seriously, consider your life choices. >>9909552

It's a fatherless half-Nigger with a whore of a mother and a beta provider as a spineless semblance of a father figure. That ugly ass kid is predestined to be in a tough spot all its life. You being a faggot on the internet doesn't improve anything about it. LINKIES are placing their bets on an actual cuck, kek $.01 EOY >>9909487
no, he's stating a logical fact. who made fun of the niglet? we are hardly making fun of rory the cuck, simple pointing out the logical fact that people who do this to themselves should commit suicide. >>9910738

if you ever tried to do that to me I can promise you it wouldn't work out well you fucking nigger. I'd put you unconscious within seconds and you'd wake up strapped to a chair in my basement so we could talk it out You are all fucking stupid arguing back and forth about the shitskin kid and it's black dick sucking mother.

All I think about when looking at this pic is that shitskin kid is probably one of the top 20 LINK wallets and I'm jealous as fuck. >>9909392
Yeah man I hate white people, really glad this global minority’s losing their countries Hello Charles, you insufferable human being. Kys >>9909392
This. OP, kys. Rory is the fucking bomb. He’s got an attractive wife to plow like a corn field every night, while you spend your Saturday mornings in your moms basement scraping the cum off of your comforter >>9911099
Here's the problem tho... white people get the last laugh even if you overrun us. Because if America is full of niggers and pajeets it'll be a fucking shithole just like every nigger and Spick community in America.

You think the white/Jewish elite in America and European countries welcoming in shitskins are doing so because they like you and because they want you to realize the American dream? They are letting you in because you shitskins are stupid and easy to enslave, which is why every Spick and nigger country is a shithole, because you idiots lean socialist and are easily exploitable by dictators.

Only whites believe in and understand freedom which is why the commies are diluting our culture with shitskins and brainwashing white women into having kids with niggers.

Just look at literally almost every tv commercial now. Blacks in every commercial, and multiracial couples in many commercials. Black men being the confident dominant person while the white male acts like a goof and retard. It's so blatant and obvious >>9909532
I agree, making fun of a kid and his family is pathetic. Posts like that should be banned, and I too would like to smack the piss out of the op. >>9909487
Roastie roastie oh so toastie

>I want to get violent with OP for pointing out the truth
Shitskin detected >>9911211
Not really making fun, just stating facts. Biztard basement dwellers don't go out much and interact with real ppl. They tend to think that their black and white corrupted visions of the world hold true in all situations.
Spending too much time here.. Some epic keks in this thread

I want to kill myself I was holding BTC I lost around 12k of savings >>9911453
Can I just ask you something? Be honest. Do you think Link is a scam shitcoin or no? >>9912322

not a scam but link over $1 technically defeats the purpose of the utility token Rory confirmed in slack What does /biz/ think about the future of BCH? >>9911609
It doesn't have long left. Tick tock >>9911609
It will go up if BTC goes up >>9911609
It's the future as a trader I don’t really pick sides and pick the one that’s mooning harder, as an anon I kinda wanna meme those blcokstream Jews to death for causing so much chaos, division and psyops in the bitcoin world >>9911609
No future at all. That shitcoin will go to 0. >>9911693
Also Reddit is totally brainwashed against beecash so I wouldn’t mind to see it win just to watch those fqggots suffer >>9911609
bcoin CRASH more like it >>9911609
When BCH surpass the lightning/banker fork, it's going to take Bitcoin dominance back to 90% market dominance as it can do almost everything every other "blockchain" try to achieve.

>Tokenization
>Smart contracts
>Instant and fee-less transactions
>Accessible for every human on earth and actually scales
>All this and still be decentralized and trustless

BCH is and always will be Bitcoin. BTC still has the dominance but will be crippled under the next bull run. Does anyone think it could pump in August? For the one year anniversary? BCH is one of the few cryptos that are actually having adoption growth right now. Big things in the future for BCH our coin
bitcoin is literally (((blockstream))) bcash is a psyop to split btc so that nobody knows which to buy, killing the unified opposition to fiat I am converted, sold majority of my btc to bch and am liking the 0conf and minimal to no frees on bitpay txs. Plus I don't have to wait for the remaining wallet balance to reconfirm inbetween sales like btc. I'll still use it as a store of wealth though. Day to day use is bch and cold stor is btc. Have to be dumb at this point not to have made the connection how both will pan.out. That's not how it works, OP... It's all a matter of reward to risk ratio:
>BTC has much higher gain potential but also much higher risk
>BCH has low gain potential and low risk
So the question is moot since the're incomparable, you either are a trader and go for BTC, or a hoarder and go for BCH. >>9911972
You sir are dumb >>9912010
Sauce on that picture? >>9911701
>Reddit
You realize 95% of the Reddit content which gets exposure there is promoted using bots and pajeets? >>9911609
BTC is backed by (((them))) and that's where the money will go. BCH is just a minercoin. I'd rather not invest based on ideology, I want to make money and really don't care if it's from Sheckelman Goldstein. /biz/ keeps telling me they ruined bitcoin, but single digit fees are currently getting cleared... >>9912010
So then I guess I'll trade my BTC and hodl by BCH >>9911609
If bch is successful. it's successful pieces will be adopted into bitcoin (btc) and then forgotten. >>9912051
It's a graduation day in Sweden. They always do that. It's going to stay in the exact position it is....locked with BTC and moving in a range. It will never be more valuable, it will never drop that much either. But, it can move bigger % wise than BTC will in the same swings. Good trading. >>9912082
This. BTC has good development, LN is working. If bch ever gets near btc then btc can just raise its blocksize to regain dominance. >>9912284
They won't raise the blocksize to get dominance and if you don't undersatnd it you deserve to get burned. >>9912319
>t.nobodyimportant >>9912320
Can you give a single logical rearson why Core didn't raise the blocksize in 2017? >>9911609
Old tech and completely outdated >>9912326
yes. >>9912005
You're falling for the store of value meme. If BTC isn't used as a currency it will have no value, and the blockstream kikes don't want it to be functional at all, the LN is just a tool to divert attention while adoption dies off.

Bitcoin Cash is quite literally the real Bitcoin and its growth and adoption cant be stopped due to the large block size which prevents BCH from ever being strangled to death.

Smart money is quietly accumulating BCH right now. >Stinky Linky Larpfolio has been prepped

There are no businesses that really come close to what smartcontract is doing. In fact, LINK will likely take down other projects like aeternity, ducatur, wanchain, etc I need new shoes, they are all worn out to hell and back, but all my money is tied to Sergey and his dream of a decentralized BigMac empire so i'm content with wearing this shit for another 6 months >>9902254

Winning the lottery is way different than making it with chainlink. 

Lottery winners literally befome rich for doing nothing.

Look at the shit we've had to deal with the last 8 months. It's seriously mentally and physically exhausting. 

When I'm worth 30 million I'll have earned every fucking penny of that dealing with you faggits and your shitposting and FUD and LARPS.

If you win the lottery people just say oh your a lucky fuck. You did nothing to earn that...

But actually figuring out and recognizing the 4th industrial revolution before anyone else is truly something to be proud about.

Pretend your worth 50 million right now because you invested Uber in the early days.... people would think you are a genius not some lucky nigger who bought a lottery ticket while buying some smokes >>9902884
That's true, there is a difference in how you got to there, but instant wealth can bring out a bunch of shit from family and friends. Some people don't know how to control their spending, etc. I just hope everyone here prepares themselves for what could be an absolute life-altering event. So this isn't so much about LINK itself, but do you guys ever wonder if we're in the middle of a general crypto recession and you wouldn't be better selling some LINK? >>9902953
>crypto recession 
Yes

>sell Link
No >>9902266

Last night testing was done on Ropsten. They were using these API's which I believe are only data from Stock Exchanges (non crypto I think)

https://polygon.io/

It is the first data I have observed that isn't ETH price related or Litecoin price related.

Also I think you have to pay for this data so it could be a bit more serious than usual >>9903668

Its not new information, we know for a long time that Sergey is in contact with Symbiont.
>After a successful pilot, Vanguard said it will begin automatic delivery of CRSP index data and intraday updates over its private blockchain sometime in 2018.
unfortunately they didn't accidentally slip out when mainnet is going live.
but makes sense when you read that news and what >>9903742 is about. >>9903666
Logic. Aeternity is an Oracle on its own blockchain. Wanchain is connecting blockchains. Link will be blockchain agonistic and will connect blockchains. Plus, it’ll likely make other oracle services obsolete I want to say one of the polygon guys is on the slack. In any case, numerous others from companies just like Polygon are on the slack and watching on github. >>9903891
that was a fun thread last night >>9903750
Oh that's cute! You want to make claims and then tell me you're not here to educate me. This isn't Tumbler. >>9902254
goddamnit. i was on this board when fucking assfuckrapeshit antshares was being shilled to death and ridiculed in the same way
if this is like antshares, ill kill myself if i didnt buy at 20 eurocents
might have to buy like 1k >>9903298
If you do not stock up as much Link as possible you will look back at this time like the people who say "I could have bought hundreds of more Bitcoin at the time". Cap this. I am sick at the thought of all you who have been scared away by all the memes and fud around Link. It's doomed Do you guys think Chainlink will get media coverage like bitcoin does? It would be pretty surreal to see the reports on this shitcoin on CNN. >>9903989
likely not that kind of coverage, I think they will advertise the products that use chainlink more than they talk about what chainlink is, like this stock indexing software that relies on chainlink. >>9903905

Okay I'll give you a hint.

The ChainLink team dedicated a whole Medium post towards it >>9904044
he's a troll. let him stay poor. >>9903989
Smart contracts (the tech, not the company) will likely get a rundown by media so people know what they are investing in 1-2 years from now >>9903989

It was on CNBC a few months ago.

Some teenage millionaire made money through 3 coins. The cube appeared on screen Chainlink is going to be bigger than beanie babies >>9902478
Really, link is gonna fuck all kinds of stuff. 

Link+Req will enable direct fiat to shitcoin, which will fuck exchanges. Functional smartcontracts will fuck any real-estate or ride-sharing bullshit.

It's even gonna fuck the central banking system by enabling a precious metals backed stable coin that will become the new soverign US currency.
Which will fulfill the prophecy of link helping to fuck the deep state >>9904391
Adaptation is the problem. Legal precedence is going to the problem. Making laws to keep up with the technology is going to be the problem. How long has Ethereum been around? SEC is still barely trying to categorize it as security or not.... going take time... a long time >>9904310

You sperg gatekeeping piece of shit. You're not suppressing the price by not posting a screen cap. Stupid idiot >>9904435
Yeah that's all true, but I don't think it will take such a long time. These institutions are going to be playing catch-up, not trailblazing. If link went live and started enabling Req's direct fiat conversion +low fee transfers globally, it would be a half year tops before nobody even said "PayPal" or "Western Union" anymore. 

I'm not arguing that there won't be big barriers to overcome, but I don't think it'll be a longer, more orderly timeline. Im thinking a shorter, more chaotic one. 

No one can afford to be left behind in this transition, because if they hesitate or mistep they'll end up like Blockbuster >>9904572
so should i buy more? is this my ticket? help me pls >>9903666
Absolute bullshit, Satan.

Link is $.0.10 EOY and most of you have lost your money.
Can we stop with the link threads already?
Like, there's not anymore newfags to try and dump your bags on, in this bear market right now.
Biz is either
A. People that know its a scam
B. Faggots that got scammed
or
C. Pajeets trying to scam Bad day. Nice thread. Lilies stay super stinky eoy1000.

0links cuz no fucking money and bad shit happening this year. Finally have job. Considering shilling some shit as I could make more money than any job I get, but have shit to almost 0 social media knowhow. Better than IRL however.

At any rate I hope links goes down for a few months so I can eventually spree buy from august on when I have some capital to play with, as the planed July one got wrecked. >>9904690
> If *Scamcoin* went live and started enabling *another Scamcoin's* direct fiat conversion....

If this was a likely outcome those 2 projects would have more investors and higher prices. 
The likely outcome is that ETH will build its own oracles, with the node collateral being ETH and the payments being in ETH aswell. Why does Link needs to be a seperate token? It doesn't, just use ETH. Chainlink € 700 eoy >>9904724
Buy more now and cost price average or buy into the Linkpool crowdsale. >>9904791
Because not everyone / business will use Ethereum. Chainlink will work with every blockchain, even private ones. >>9904803

You're right, not every company or transaction needs decentralized oracles.... but for the one s that does, smartcontrac (the company), offers 1 stop shop for -writing of a contract -signing of legal docs - Decentralized oracles. >>9905023

Might be also a nice subconscious prod as havong something staked in the game as I slowly research smartcontracts and oracle beyond a general overview, until I manage to get some relatively minor capital to hopefully at that time throw at it with some idea beyond the meme and the promise of what it can do but no through understanding. >>9905093

I hope very low, so that EU countries decouple from Frankfurt monetary policy(do eet Italy!) of the suprastate, and others are not get draged into it

Thus I do not like this as a new meme.

So I made a telegram channel for related discussions about ChainLink.

Rules
-Group will be small around 50 people
-No organisation of p&d
-No cringey shit in the chat 
-everyone needs to contribute actively 

Goal:
Basically like this thread , trying to find leads, wallet autism and technical discussion

Thinking about also requesting some proof of having a +5k link stack.

>22 dubs

Spooky Absolute shitcoin.

There solution is all theoretical with no actual product.

Sort of like cheese. From what I've been seeing and hearing, LINK and /biz/ is the most surreal thing to ever happen. This will be on the level of Hillary talking about Pepe. What do I mean by that? Most financial firms are completely aware that 99% of blockchain tech right now is a joke, the only reason Wall Street is pumping corporations involving blockchain is too dupe boomers. The important people, the experts, all know that most of the shit coming is useless vapourware and the incessant decentralisation/tokenisation of everything is ridiculous. One of my coworkers was even laughing about Ripple the other day calling it a glorified SMS service.

The difference is ChainLINK is supposed to be the FIRST in the new wave of true utility function tokens, following Ethereum. Ethereum took the big guys by surprise, that has a real use case, but ChainLINK is an industry token from the ground up.

One of the weirdest thing was that these institutions didn't even want to do an ICO, but then they realised they had to because the whole POINT of LINK is to be a true industry built blockchain but if it doesn't have even a slight claim to decentralisation then it doesn't really meet its goal. So paradoxically these banks and insurance companies HAVE to let you guys in on their cash cow, that's why they are desperately trying NOT to market it. Because they DO NOT WANT YOU in their club. But 4chan being the turbo autists that you are, you found and bought this shit right up. Kudos.

In other words ChainLINK isn't just the most promising blockchain coming out, it's going to lead the charge and be the industry standard for blockchain tech. The days of blockchains that tweet out memes targeting millennials are coming to an end, the corporate blockchain is coming >>9908548
I'll be lucky anon no.2 >>9909814
AHAHAHAHAHAH >>9903668
fucking larper, theres been no testing since linkpool >>9909814
Your bags must be heavy. Let's not kid ourselves, the idea for LINK is pretty good, but the project itself is garbage.

If you unironically believe this to be otherwise you haven't done your due diligence.

Projects like this aren't going to be done anytime soon, especially in this day and age where scalability hasn't been addressed for a global scale.

You're either a snake oil salesman or the fool being sold to.

Now tell me I'm only here to FUD to keep the price down to fill my bags ;) >>9908465
Nah, people will sell at different prices while others will stack and won't sell at all. Also there aren't that many people who invested in chainlink anyway. 
There are 15 million millionaires in the world but less than 10k chainlink wallets so less than 10k new millionaires will barely make a difference >>9902254
It's shit, but good source of memes. It's hilarious how it all started as a meme, shilling a (almost) random shitcoin on biz, and now there are more unaware newfags than people actually know it was just a meme from the beginning. >>9909933

Why would someone apart from Mat or Jonny themselves promote the fucking crowdsale? They don't deserve to receive a single ETH. Their code is obscure as fuck, in private repositories. If it works after they release it, stake your linkies with them, but they don't need 1000 ETH. They have been greedy as fuck.
Also the more people get in, the smaller the reward is. Stop promoting them >>9910746

Didn't someone write the same thing in an eth thread before it blew up? >>9912123
We'll the token hasn't even been out for a full year yet. You also have to take the market into account. An anti hype token without a product yet gets hit hard in a bear market. Eth bounced around and didn't hit $10 for 18 months, in much better albeit different market conditions.

What will really drive links price is adoption. If there a lot of institutions using the network, and only a relatively small number of people running nodes, the payments will all be going to that small number of node operators. The returns for the would be massive. When people see this, they will buy Link to stake themselves. Now that the amount of node operators has increased, supply and demand will find an equilibrium at a certain rate of returns. Essentially the more adoption of the network the higher price the token will be. Also take in to account speculation, and the fact that most Link will eventually be consolidated to node operators and won't be on the market. >>9904940
You don't understand.
NEETs were created for this purpose, their whole purpose in life is to serve the economic system and the financial elite by becoming a decentralized oracle provider hivemind.
It was their plan all along. >>9912199
Everyone here believes because it happened in the past it'll happen again. It was a different time then. I don't think you guys understand the link is actually going to have to be used and work or it'll go to zero. There will be no speculation or hype pump to $10, $100. It's either all or nothing. >>9912223
This

>>9912259
Correct, once people see the companies using the mainnet later this year, instant moon to $1000 >>9912316
>Correct, once people see the companies using the mainnet later this year, instant moon to $1000
As much as this would be ideal it's going to take 2-3 years for adoption. Link price won't be driven by speculation only it's true utility and network worth. >>9912259
What this also means of course, is that if link does blow up, the price is more likely to stay up cause it won't be based purely on speculation >>9909814

ETC the REAL Ethereum  There's nothing wrong with the chain pausing. Just didn't happen on ETH because it's a copy of BTC with a few changes to allow for smart contracts, BTC had moments like this too when it started.
If the software run by nodes is faulty then a decentralized chain can 'pause' until the software is fixed.

Even ethereum having plasma + sharding, and all other chains like Zilliqa, NEO etc WILL NOT reach over 10k viable TPS anytime soon. Maybe ethereum might start doing over 10k in year 2030 and still even 100kTPS is not anywhere near enough for numerous comercial scale DAPPS like a facebook or a twitter, because of the number of transactions in votes, posts, retweets, etc... Not to mention paying fees for every transaction is retarded and the EOS model is much more ideal.

EOS will scale to over millions of TPS with interchain communication within paralel chains.

All you ETH fags will be fomoing when the VCs start pushing out project after project and the demand for EOS skyrockets. It's not that you don't believe in EOS, it's that you don't want to understand the DPOS BFT model. There's 200 BPs and stand-by nodes not to mention validator nodes so the 21 BPs actions are heavily monitored.

DPOS has been seen working on Steemit, Bitshares, Ark, Lisk. EOS is made by the inventor of DPOS, look at Dan Larimers track record.

Only weak hands and brainlets are dropping their coins right now.
Don't buy EOS on this dip, STAY POOR FUCKING KILL ME Wish I had that right now.
I need me some income.
Crypto not working
Anon, teach me. >Garnish his wages. >>9906015
At least you have a job. Op is a faggot. >>9906015
who needs more money than that honestly >>9906033
>Get CDL 
>Get job operating equipment that is mounted on CDL vehicle 

That easy faggot >>9906052
So you drive a truck and a Moffett? Most anons lost money this week and have no work ethic. And it’s the weekend. So...like...you’ve got that going for you. >>9906052

I can get this and a job all by next week? >>9906066
I operate some special equipment vital to construction that is mounted on a rig that requires a CDL >>9906015
$21 per hour is good pay, idiot. >>9906094

ye not bad. OP it could be worse. >>9906015
Utterly cucked >>9906094
It's ok but I'm about to ask for like $25 or I'm out. working this many hours is literal hell even tho I'm 23 and able bodied >>9906086
Sounds like it could be fun. I just have a class B CDL but I already make $29hr/$43.50hr OT as an armed security guard for a medical marijuana company. Beats driving a dump truck for $15hr. >>9906015
What is that net? I used to earn $25 an hour 15 years ago when i was 18.. today i work for $12 an hour. >>9906149
>working 55 hours a week is too much

wew laddy >>9906179
I mean are we talking *work* work or...? Op is trying to humblebrag where techcucks are making 300kyr waxing their carrot What are you? 13?
55 hours really isn’t that much. And you would have people on part time wages that would kill to have more work. >>9906077
pretty much, there is literally always a demand for CDL in logistics >>9906179
I work 30h tops and get about the same as OP (although on a 37% tax kek) >>9906233
this
i got an internship this summer... i actually thought i would be working for free.
nope, they're paying me $9k per month + $5k stipend for housing >>9906149

>55 hours
>literal hell

You’ve got to be kidding me >>9906206
I do that many hours and im working the entire time. Im jealous of every wagecuck on /biz/ that gets to shitpost from work. If i look at my phone for 30 seconds i get yelled at :( >>9906015
Part time master race. Living at home with no bills, sip and trade when I'm off. Who here /comfy/? >>9906337
This is per fortnight, r-right? >>9906364
Yes, I work two 8's per week. One on, three days off, one on, four days off. I used to milk my old job though, especially for minor holidays. This is the goal boys, this was last year when I was 21 for reference. >>9906015
work two jobs, have no life, get little sleep, sleep in your car if you can. 
do this for two years, you save most of it because you cant spend.
buy a house outright with low property taxes and as small a hoa fee as possible
congrats, you have no mortgage and turned a 30 year mortgage into a 3. 
Read the book your money or your life and think very carefully if you want to spend 30 years paying a mortgage. >>9906337
what job are you working thats paying an hourly rate of 33 dollars while also being part time..?

anything beyond 25 an hour for a part time is practically impossible to find >>9906244
Then let them have it. Just because you don't mind it doesn't mean everyone should deal with it. This coming from a guy working 65 hrs this week due to shit co"workers" >mfw I only get paid $15 an hour
>mfw I only got $1,200 for two weeks of work.
>mfw most of it is gone due to bills

There has to be more to life. >>9906149
for awhile there when i was first starting off i worked around 80hrs a week as a CNA of all things. 
you dont even have it bad. i bet you work in a factory which isnt so bad >>9906561
Healthcare. I know what you mean though, it's tough out there 

>>9906666
You still in the field bro? >>9906149
faggot I worked 60+ hrs a week when I was 16. Grow a pair >>9906336
Naw fuck anyone that doesn't work from the moment they arrive to the moment they leave. If you can get away with not doing this you don't work a real job. Don't be jealous of tumors >>9906646
get some skills so you're worth more than $15 an hour. it's that simple >>9906033
Anyone can work, just try to be the ideal worker you would hire if it was you who had to find and trust someone to do that job. I.e. work hard, don't fuck around to much yet try to be pleasant, etc. A lot of people are fuck-ups. If you always do your best and put some real effort in what you do, you're already above 90% of the working population.

If you want to get involved in work politics, sure, that exists too, to better your position or whatever, but just getting a job is not that hard. >>9906015
in my country it takes 10 years to earn that >>9906699
I really wonder how some people calculate their work hours. I do 5 x 11 to 13 hour shifts a week, so let's say 60 hours a week. I don't get how it's possible to do real work for much more than that.

That's on average a 12 hour day. If you had breaks and time to eat, that's one hour more, and add to that an hour of commute. So that's already 14 hours out of the day. Add to that 8 hours for sleep (including getting ready for sleep, waking up, brushing teeth, pooing, etc.) and you're at 22 hours. If you try to exercise a bit (1 hour, including shower) and take another hour for routine stuff (breakfast and supper, checking email, etc.) all the day is gone.

I get that some people can work more than 5 days a week, but after five days of this I'm kind of comatose (like now) and need the weekend to recuperate or else I would burn out and wouldn't be able to continue doing the kind of job that I'm supposed to do, which takes a lot of focus.

How can people say they work 100 hours a week or some dumb shit? Do they include breaks, commute, time they're on call and "meetings"? Or are they just larping? I just don't see how it's possible to do much more than 60 hours of anything actually demanding job without burning out or falling apart. >>9906861
I did 72 hours last week. Almost died. Continuous 100hr weeks are bullshit, nobody can pull it off. Im 18 never had a job. Well atleast not mcdonalds or carwash or whatever. Worked with my dad doing contracting and construction. Need a job but 1. Dont have a drivers license, 2. Dont have any references that arent family and 3. I have long hair (which is sometimes a put off to people)
Any advice? I hate applying online so i get the applications in person. Need a job soon. thanks bros. 6'4 and white (thank god) >>9906984
Look in the mirror and say "I will stop being a NEET" 100 times >>9906892
It can be fun sometimes to do these kind of things sometimes, it brings you in a kind of zen state, kind of like long. distance running, but yeah it's not really healthy or sustainable, mentally or physically, to do 70 hours or more. As for 100 hours a week, I still don't see how that's possible... I might be a bit autistic because I timed everything I was doing for years (I stopped doing it because it's not really worth it anymore) but I don't think a lot of people truly work the number of hours they claim. >>9906015
i work 1/3 as much as you do and bring in the same, feels fucking awesome >>9906015
This is pretty good for a weekly salary anon, wtf are you gloating for >>9906035

What the fuck? Doing what? Who /7dayweek/ here? >>9906686
I was gonna say, that’s a nursefag paystub if I ever saw one, looks a lot like my RN slips in those days. Good gig, I was OR though, on call sucked dick. ER/urgent care DNP now, money’s great with production pay but still horseshit compared to MD. Oh well. Thumbs up to you bro/sis. You’re living the dream. Just don’t fuck it up and get married like I did. Do some 13 week contract jobs- 50-60/hr, paid housing/food stipends tax free of 800.00/week- hory shit I did that for 2 years and was shitting money >>9907338
>5 days a week, 8 hour shifts
>one 16 hour shift on the weekend

it almost feels like 7 days since the day after a 16 hour shift is usually wasted from feeling like shit >>9907318
Live action role-playing >>9907405
Man that's awesome, how long were you in the field before going back for the DNP? I'm aiming for CRNA honestly, had a friend put a good word in for me so if I'm lucky I'll be going to the trauma ICU. If not I'll definitely do some travel contracts. Cali pays ridiculously well, I hear Kaiser pays 70-90 in the bay area.

Just apply online to whatever is available. It will take time and lots of applications (you would be lucky if you got 1 interview per 30 applications). Just keep applying online and in person, eventually you will make it.

Obviously arrive neat and tidy too. >>9907579
Chipped away low and slow, Periop RN for 13 years, DNP 2016. Yeah, CRNA is awesome. Weighed it, decided I hated call so much it wasn’t worth the cake. That and the unreal stress. Dumbass surgeon overinflates a belly and the diaphragm spasms? Yours. Kid larygospasms after extubating? Yours. Patient refuses to go down or wakes up? Same. Nah, I’m cool. But go for it, all good vibes for you. Best wishes. And yeah, bought some BTC in 2011, forgot it, (didn’t buy pizza or drugs on silkroad) and since I’m a terrible lazy hoarder of my old PCs I dusted off the old Dell Inspiron and followed some online tutorials to find the wallet and what do you know? My coins were still there. Wasn’t a lot, but enough. I don’t actively trade cuz busy as fuck but now hold 50% BTC/ETH and rest in Stellar based systems. I met Jed once and have some networking contacts who convinced me. We’ll see. >>9908009
Cut your fucking hair. Buy yourself some khakis and a shirt- it’s part of the program. You’ll reach a point where you can have your hair long or roll up your sleeves and have visible tats. But you haven’t earned the right so get ready for trenches. Refusing to tow the line will fuck you up and leave you at Subway.

Write down 10 industries or fields that you have even a remote interest in. Then map out anything within public transportation, bike, or walking commute. My personal beef, and I’m the medfag from above and I’ve resigned and moved cross country in the past over this, is that I shouldn’t have to spend more than 30 minutes getting to a job I work really hard at. NO. FUCK THAT.
Once mapped out, clean up well, study a few business etiquette introduction videos and learn to gulp down your NEET and control it. Walk in confident, smiling, and charismatic without being a cocky fuck. Look people in the eye, nod, let them finish speaking. Walk into a few places of interest- don’t be scared of a flashy law firm, dental office, or corporate place if that’s what you’re interested in. Have some cards, yes, fucking cards. With your name and email and phone. Make friendly with the reception or clerk or whomever you meet, they WILL talk about you to people that matter. Fuck online applications, it’s a stumbling block. I promise you- even if directed to apply online through HR, your application will be looked at simply because you had the balls/ovaries to walk in.

You’ll get a call even if you don’t have experience, be direct and tell them to you want to work in this field, are willing to learn and grind, and you’re gonna run into someone like myself or another who admires old school gumption. Be ready and willing to do shitwork.

El atrocidad... I was getting paid 26/hr for essentially sitting on my ass all day but I got laid off a few weeks ago.

Finalizing interviews now, hoping to get to 36/hr but will probably end up at 31/hr which is still ok. I don't have rent or shit since my parent's left me their house while working out of state. >>9906015

That's a week. That's monthly average for a wagecuck in Italy(a bedroom/shared bedroom in cities goes for 2/300 a month, a small two room apartment is 100k € or 500 a month+expenses in rent average, far more if you are in Milan or Rome for example). Leaving aside Italy's current shitty situation in the global system, are you implying that's low? Is life that expensive in the US? 

I'm just curious since I see people in your situation a lot on here. I don't understand anymore if you're all exaggerating or not. I’m nearly qualified accountant but making only $30k a year, they are paying for my studies which are worth around $10k but still I don’t think I’m on enough especially as been working 60hour weeks recently. 

Will probably leave when qualified.

I’ve been making mistakes recently though, mostly due to lack of sleep so in bit of shit.

Any other accountants here or are you all just professional crypto shillers. >>9907168

At least you have a social safety net though. Our burgertaxes just get spent on the military. You get sick here? Get fucked, treatment will only be 500k. Beautiful system we have here Most of Americans have forgotten the golden rule to making it. I have neighbors on my street who own 5 houses all next to each other or across the street. Wanna know why the eldest son worked his ass off plumbing under someone until he saved up for tools and a house. Daughters same way don't really know what they do. I'm talking about house that are maybe 200k max. Moral of the story is this live with family or friends and save dat money on cheaper bills. Yeah its tough being so close to other people but you know what the end results outweigh the short term negative. God I forgot how cringey it was seeing people give job advice. It’s like hearing baby boomers yap about mortgages and going vacation. Just so gay. 


Wanna know how you get a job? Know someone. We live in a job market filled with druggies, niggers, and beaners. Employers would like to avoid most of these people if possible. The mere fact that someone will be able to vouch for you is more important than anything else. 

Occasionally you’ll run into a company that holds its employees opinions low enough that they won’t hire referrals, but you really don’t want to work there anyway. >>9911687
>forget golden rule
>jump to neighbours who own 5 houses

LEARN ENGLISH ARE YOU A SHITSKIN??? >>9911463
lol no that doesnt exist. Income tax is usually around 24, with some extremes such as denmark at 36%. Employer also pays 12-16% on top of your income tax, so yes technically around 50%, but of that 1/3 is hidden and is NOT being deducted from the salleries posted be eurocucks.

To Serve Man. A cautionary tale about demilitarization, welfare state, benevolent dictators and leftist shit in general. Been a long time since I read this Paste this everywhere because no one will be able to refute it:

Nobody is looking into staking RISKS.

Look up Vitalik's presentation at the most recent EDCON. Check out how much effort you're going to have to put in just to keep watch over your coins.

Your VPN goes offline for a few minutes? 
>You lose your coins. 
You vote against the consensus? 
>You lose your coins. 
Your pool gets hacked?
>You lose your coins.
Your coins get sent to a leaky smart contract?
>You lose your coins.

Tough shit! They're gone forever. Shouldn't have gone against the consensus hehehe

And don't even get me started on Vitalik's prisoner dilemma solution to pool centralization! You better think twice about joining the largest pool if you think there's security in that.

And what do you get for the joy of forever incurring a massive black cloud of the stress of immediate financial ruin over which you have absolutely no control?

Aren't the staking returns pretty low anyway? I could be pulling this out of my ass, but I think I remember someone saying it was only like 5 percent. Correct me if I'm wrong. If that's true, you could make more staking other coins anyway >>9911322
The offline penalties are set so that you only lose money if you are offline more than half the time. >>9911335
Correct
>>9911340
Wrong Are you really surprised the one legitimate smart contract platform aiming to power legitimate businesses is using staking as a valid consensus model, rather than a glorified dividends scheme to attract dunning-kruger idiots as in current PoS chains? Staking should be a job, and low rewards is the goal. Source? I want to believe you’re lying but with everything that’s been happening recently vitamin butterscotch could have actually done this Ty, preparing to buy another 100k, Bart you l8r >>9911549
>Staking should be a job, and low rewards is the goal.
Do you understand the dilemma of what you just wrote >>9911482
No it's correct, Vitalik wrote it in several places. I don't care enough to look for it, provide evidence if I'm wrong >>9911322
it's self regulating; if fewer people are willing to take those risks, they'll get more rewards

...and do you understand that slashing is not the same as deleting your entire staked amount? 1. Vitalik is journalist
2. Vitalik public face of gang of scamers >>9911632
who gives a fuck about what dilemma the stakers have? the protocol is designed to provide minimal incentive, not to enrich stakers - how are you so stupid? >>9911482
>>9911887
To expand, the design is so that stakers lose money for inactivity when they're online less than half the time if most of the network is online.
Penalties rise proportionally (or quadratically? I don't remember) to how others are behaving. The logic is that your node malfunctions you're going to be the only one with that error, so the penalty is small. A big attack means many nodes are doing it.
The penalty for being offline along with the others discourages use of pools and dedicated hosting solutions. You're supposed to run it in your home. OP speaks the truth. Why anyone would want to stake eth must be a brainlet. >>9912192
I'm going to stake eth, the risks are manageable >>9911963
Minimal incentive = no one staking. How are you so stupid? >>9912224
minimal implies stakers are still incentivized you absolute retard

the amount of returns you get by staking is partly controlled by the total amount of ether staked (on the entire network)

since you're absolutely retarded I'll spell it out for you: if no one is staking the rewards to stake will be absolutely insane, so people will begin staking until the rewards reach the sweet spot where staking is only barely worth it Shill me the next 100x. >>9911186

of course you can also go long if you like that I have a very shy short. Why did it release?

Because I have no coins. >>9907029

acceptance/depression. also this board is much slower since a while. Why do you think this board is so dead? We fucking sold and are actually waiting for new lows. >>9907085
Nah mate. Fucking holding.

OP I'm calm because I was never all in, just in with about $100,000, which is still a fucking lot to me. So either BTC hits the bottom and I can buy in at the bottom, or this is the bottom and it keeps going up. The only negative is if it keeps going sideways like this forever. I'm not a nigger and therefore I look at yearly movement rather than daily or weekly movement. Yawn. Because I have been cucked by the market now

Never gave a shit of the tech
Just wanted gains. I refuse to exit this low, then hear days later it mooned. I want 1 fucking btc bounce and then I'll prob exit all positions I've been liquidated already I have nothing to lose if it crashes to $500 I have $2000 of fiat ready >>9907029

seriously, who the fuck doesn't punch out after hitting the all time high and it declines by even 5%? By what possible logic would anybody justify holding? Sheer stupidity. Hodlers are fucking retards. >>9908825

With Crypto? This might be true for stocks, but a 5% decline in bitcoin can easily be followed by a 25% gain in 15 min. especially during a crazy bullmarket

Nobody knows what 5% decline will become a 50% decline. >why is everyone so /calm/ right now

it's extremely nervous silence right now >>9908825

He seems to have a record of shilling coins. Maybe to unload bags I dunno. He's smart but probably has damage in a certain areas of his brain due to his lifestyle. He is a deranged individual Prepare for REQ to be listed along with ZRX and other coins on coinbase pro coming by the end of the month. This shit is ridiculously undervalued right now, don't see why more people don't see how hype this will be While I hold REQ & ZRX I'm not convinced a pump will happen. ETC barely moved when it was announced and ETH being declared "not a security" barely caused a pump. >>9911289
Moon moon the 29th of June! If only it wasn't a bare market.. >>9911289

It will add 15% to REQ TOPS. Which means it'll go up to 12 cents at best. >>9912019
Literally any volume on REQ will cause it to moon, it's been shit on so hard for months now that I'd be surprised if we didn't see a nice rebound. >>9912132
I want to believe, but I have serious reservations that good news will do anything for this coin. You shills are getting desperate. ETC won't be listed for at least a couple months. It's like some of you have no reading comprehension >>9912149
Honestly an understandable sentiment, let's see what happens. I made sure to pick up a little extra req today just in case. >>9912019
But who holds ETC? Shit coin i sold all my req. im buying back in when its clear that coinbase wont list req and the price dumps under 1000 sats.

OR

REQ gets in fact listed, but because REQ is such an fucking shitcoin it only pumps a few percent and then it dumps under 1000 sats >>9912295

Producers are working on it now. They are all shutting down nodes to downgrade to 1.0.3 (not sure if this 1.0.3 is for some thing else and not meaning mainnet at the moment). Will take 3 to 6 hours. The chain will be restarted from irreversible block 1027926.

Edit 1:

AT 9:56 UTC the EOS mainnet blockchain paused. At 10:01 UTC Block Producers and many Standby Nodes joined together on an international conference call to identify and fix the issue. At 10:57 UTC The choice was made that all Standby Block Producers would stop their nodes and backup any information that could helpful in diagnosing the problem.

At 11:02 UTC, a method to unpause the chain was formulated and is currently underway. Normal functions should be available within 3 to 6 hours from the time of the publication. Incoming connections to the network are not being accepted while the work is taking place. Please wait for an update from the Top 21 Block Producers before attempting EOS mainnet transactions.

Updates will be provided as they happen. >>9911506

If transactions aren't free even on something like Ethereum then why/ how would anyone use it for something like 'liking' on a social network dapp costs money, even a fraction of a cent? You know I would say something like this is why you should always wait until they have a working product before you throw money at something, but then 99% of coins wouldn’t exist >>9911542
explain. Eos sold most of their ethers on bitfinex, they likely have $1xxM there, and someone is buying millions worth in a very tight range.
If someone was actually looking to buy eos they would allow the dump to happen. >>9911529

Blocks will be replayed until last irreversible block.
Block producers will sync to each other.

I'll enjoy watching block.one and anyone who thinks EOS isn't just an unregulated money laundering cartel try to talk their way out of this one There's nothing wrong with this, it happens. Just didn't happen on ETH because it's a copy of BTC with a few changes to allow for smart contracts, BTC had moments like this too when it started.
If the software run by nodes is faulty then a decentralized chain can 'pause' until the software is fixed.

Even ethereum having plasma + sharding, and all other chains like Zilliqa, NEO etc WILL NOT reach over 10k viable TPS anytime soon. Maybe ethereum might start doing over 10k in year 2030 and still even 100kTPS is not anywhere near enough for numerous comercial scale DAPPS like a facebook or a twitter, because of the number of transactions in votes, posts, retweets, etc... Not to mention paying fees for every transaction is retarded and the EOS model is much more ideal.

EOS will scale to over millions of TPS with interchain communication within paralel chains.

All you ETH fags will be fomoing when the VCs start pushing out project after project and the demand for EOS skyrockets. It's not that you don't believe in EOS, it's that you don't want to understand the DPOS BFT model. There's 200 BPs and stand-by nodes not to mention validator nodes so the 21 BPs actions are heavily monitored.

DPOS has been seen working on Steemit, Bitshares, Ark, Lisk. EOS is made by the inventor of DPOS, look at Dan Larimers track record.

Only weak hands and brainlets are dropping their coins right now.

(this is my cope strategy, so leave me alone)

Today I'll leave it up to /biz/ whether this thread should live or die. 
Comment and I'll reply, I'll teach you anything about ZenCash there's to know. 

> Part which should most intrigue you: 

ZenCash's node structure may be the absolute best hedge you can get into now. 
Once ZenCash forks to upgrade to super nodes on July-19, 
the system will payout the following per supernode.

ZEN @ 5$ = 212$/month
ZEN @ 10$ = 425$/month 
ZEN @ 20$ = 830$/month
ZEN @ 30$ = 1255$/month
ZEN @ 40$ = 1700$/month
ZEN @ 50$ = 2100$/month

(approximately a guaranteed ZEN ROI of 50-100%) >>9905886

At least if you get in now. 
Should you get in at 5$, you can obviously buy 4x as much nodes than today. 
But even if you get in at 50$, you still get 50-100% ROI over your ZEN holdings over a year.

Why? Because economics brainlet, supply and demand >>9898064
DYOR, although I know a lot about ZenCash I may not be 100% right all of the time. just tell me how i get from 168 Zen to 500 i cant make it until it blows up >>9910616

You could try and swing trade (wouldn't advice), historically there has always been a dump during the night. And around this time we start going up. Doesn't always hold true right after a huge pump like we just had, you can try. But 4 secure nodes aren't that bad after the fork.

Per secure node:

ZEN @ 5$ = 18$/month
ZEN @ 10$ = 36$/month 
ZEN @ 20$ = 72$/month
ZEN @ 30$ = 108$/month
ZEN @ 40$ = 144$/month
ZEN @ 50$ = 180$/month

https://securenodes.lebre.net/

Still geared towards 95% ROI within a given year over your ZEN.
Not that bad. Especially in case we do rally up beyond 50$. 

Or maybe I'll set up a faucet at a later time to help others complete their super nodes. >>9910694
im not really sure how you come up with these numbers. we have ~12k secure nodes atm and with a 5$ price for a VPS i get a return of 12$/month at the current zen price while you say 18$/month at 5$ per zen >>9910889
Why should people buy ZEN , if the inflation is this high? What purpose does ZEN fulfill right now that people would buy in so they can dump their bags on them? Tell me. >>9910889

Its a guesstimate more or less. Because when super nodes come online we may have as much as 50% convert from secure to super nodes. Then you will have only ~6000 secure nodes online. It may be less than 50% but I figured is the fairest estimate you can get at this point. Lets say only 10% convert, then Supernode holders would be pretty damn rich in the first months. 

>>9910903
> Why should people buy ZEN , if the inflation is this high?

The inflation is actually very low if you approach it from a demand/supply view: >>9898064 - You are looking at ~300-400 nodes added weekly on average. That's a restriction of 31% of the weekly minted supply. Additionally these nodes go on to capture 20% of the monthly mining from rewards. Node operators will also have much less of a incentive to sell all their rewards like miners do (to cover hardware and electricity costs). 

> What purpose does ZEN fulfill right now that people would buy in so they can dump their bags on them?

Please read the previous thread, if only the first and second post.
ZenCash's purpose is to be somewhat of a decentralized financial self sustaining econ-system (or a bootstrap start up nation).
With most coins you follow the greater fools theory of someone buying your bags when your reach your profit goal.
But with ZenCash you are more or less participating in a greater network experiment where ROI is what matters more than the coins price. >>9910889
I believe those prices are after the fork next month. You should be making $26 per node after VPS fees next month. >>9911061

Correct, those post-fork rewards.
Here are the current rewards: https://zen.lebre.net >>9911022
okay lets do a liberal calculation to not understate the payouts here. Even with only 6000 nodes (50% conversion rate to supernodes, which i think is unrealistic but nvm) and no cost for a vps i only get 6.30$ per month per secure node at a price of 5$/zen that is still FAAAR off from your calc. 
at 20$ we are looking at 25$ per month...
im not trying to say the payouts are bad or zen sucks im just wondering how you got to these numbers because they are very very far off from what i calculated.
are you lying to us zenanon?! >>9911074
alright im a brainlet i didnt factor in they are changing the rewards im gonna reevaluate, sorry fren >>9911097

One supernode at 20$ currently pays 4.60$ at 12000 global nodes at 20$ per ZEN and 8$ in hosting fees (according to: https://zen.lebre.net). With the same stats you are sitting at (see pic). But if nodes would half, it would be 91% ROI and 72$ or actually 64$ after deducting hosting. 

 https://securenodes.lebre.net

> are you lying to us zenanon?!

No, but math could be off. >>9911158
i came to roughly the same numbers now, my bad.
this is actually pretty fucking insane.
wil be interesting to see how many people actually will convert to supernodes >>9911022
Yeah so, why should new people buy the coin? It literally has zero use case, who keep on on buying our staking rewards if the coin itself touted “privacy coin” has no fucking use case and is attacked recently. >>9911172

> this is actually pretty fucking insane.

It is! And that's only half of it. This is not just some random project, it already has its own investment trust (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/grayscale-announces-new-fund-around-privacy-based-crypto-173601246.html), where only SEC accredited investors can invest. So you have a legal investment system, where ROI can be almost absolutely guaranteed as long all investors remain rational and don't dump their nodes. Going to be very interesting to see where this goes.

And then maybe you understand what this about anon. follow the big money

grayscale's lowest mcap coin is zcash with 800 million

zencash is 77 million >>9911329

Charles Hoskinson, Roger Ver, IOHK and Coindesk all have a positive relationship (and/or partnerships) with ZenCash as well. Coindesk is owned by DGC & Grayscale and Bitcoin.com shills ZenCash already for a "Nakamoto Consensus" change (wonder if we'll see that on BCash....hmm). There are simply too many big names involved with ZenCash for this not to be something big. And for GBTC/Grayscale to put their reputation and SEC license on the line would also be an unthinkable risk. >>9910211
You're doing gods work, as a missionary or freedom and privacy. >>9911269
Fuck anon you're top tier shiller. great job More:

Take a look at MakerDAO. It is a decentralized structure of smart contracts, representing a leveraged banking lending system. With multi-collateral assets pegged to stable coins (soon). By using the system (once its done), you benefit from the same financial freedom and additional (leverage) benefits, only a very tiny amount of people has. To understand and benefit from MakerDAO you would actively be using/utilizing the system instead of playing the greater fools game with the MKR token. 

ZenCash is something similar but on a different note,
a cryptographic econ-system based on structures of traditional finance and economics. 

Easier example: P3D is a decentralized representation of a financial Ponzi
We will see much more of these systems pop up. 

Trading / Investing in Crypto is only a single aspect of what Cryptocurrency has to bring us. 
It just has taken devs so this long to starting gluing things together. 

People in the 90's and early 00's already knew Bitcoin was possible, but it took much longer than that. 
Szabo was one of those people in first describing "smart contracts" and representing economic structures:

http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_2.html


> Digital cash is here today, and many more smart contract mechanisms are being designed. So far the design criteria important for automating contract execution have come from disparate fields like economics and cryptography, with little cross-communication: little awareness of the technology on the one hand, and little awareness of its best business uses other. The idea of smart contracts is to recognize that these efforts are striving after common objectives, which converge on the concept of smart contracts.

Laggards now. Late majority was in april/may Absolutely not, most of the large projects have huge marketcaps and their mainnet launched. The fact that Charlie Lee, a guy with connections at the big exchanges cashed out all his coins at ath in December should tell you all you need to know. >>9911660
Don't listen to these faggots. There has hardly been adoption yet. All you've seen is trading on price speculation. How many real use cases have you seen in action? Think 10 years from now when actual use cases are the norm in different industries. Just because you've speculative bubble in December/January doesn't mean you've seen the end of crypto. You've probably seen the end to useless shitcoins being pumped for no reason. Choose projects wisely, anon. >>9911695
Where is the adoption? depends what coin you bought
if you bought BTC then no >>9911789
There is no adoption and there never will be, normies find it too hard to figure out crypto. Yes. I sat in on a panel discussion with the heads of the major hospitals in the US, the MS Informative guy, and the CIOs from blockchain startups in the healthcare sector. 

They are still incubating and piloting. The real shocker was the audience questions who was compromised of spurgs like myself, mid level IT, HIMMs, Interop. People...literally some of the most idiotic questions like "what's the difference between btc and blockchain?" "Is Ethereum like money but makes decisions?" And "SQL is King" etc... This was last week. This does not mean to imply all shitcoins will moon again, just adoption / comprehension is probably 5% in the US.

I took the time to write this because I'm damn tired of the negative Nancy's trying to get people to sell. They all want you to sell...and are sadists. Don't be a victim of frequency bias. yes, normies still unironically think it's a scam >>9911680

Attention and adoption are not the same. Only 576,000 addresses World wide hold more than 1 bitcoin (including exchanges).

I believe that there will be more blockchain uses in the future. Even the DoD is starting to research how they may benefit from the tech.

Nobody at that time could imagine all of the uses for the internet that we have today, 3 decades later. https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=bitcoin,facebook

Hahaha, this trainwreck. 

EOS literally gets paused by 21 parties, whole chain is paused. Whatever happened to immutability and decentralization. EOS is a joke of a blockchain and it's actually starting to look like this whole thing will come crashing down much sooner than I thought. 

Solid A+ 10 billion dollar product here. 

The shills on /biz/ kept calling for 1000 functional dApps on release and refuting the worries of there not being a core wallet, voting system and generally just fucked up collusion going on with the BP's. 

Jesus what a shitshow. >>9911368
dpos is a failed experiment
unless it has a randomization aspect like MAN or IOTX it will never work >>9911368
whole voting system fucks it. >>9911442
It's insane really how stupid EOS investors are, they don't understand how decentralization works. How can they not see how they're getting scammed?

You have 21 people all getting together to solve problems with each other in backroom chats, developing relationships with each other...you quickly realize these people are securing billions of dollars they don't own and will "work together" to protect their own interests.

EOS's so called ability to move fast to fix these things is a symptom of it's biggest underlying problem.

This shit is just as bad as XRP. >>9911368

HAHAHAHAHA PLEASE POST LINK PLEASEEEE >>9911368

I would hesitate to say that, BitShares could be viewed as a success, but the problem is scale. And now that it looks like, on the one dimension where they claim to excel over ETH, guess what, they are years behind, oh and also, EOS is not and never will be decentralized. So, 4 billion dollars just went down the U-bend, all EOS is good for at this point is all the ETH is holds. Stupid fucks you got Larimered. >>9911461
A post which is not retarded, kinda strange.
I understand eos "investors" and their delusion, but you must be exceptional normie to believe that 21 block producers constitute as decentralization.
Eos basically made slower visa, by throwing out decentralization.
You can hate eth and skelly, but you must admit that eth "just works" ™ and is de facto platform for all crypto derivative projects >>9911491
yep, dpos is going to work just fine as a consensus model for eth sidechains like what loom is offering
eosfags will get to see free scalable commercial apps, it's just going to be on the network they shunned because of their greed >>9911368
>"The chain is paused. All BPs are on it." "It's under control."
I'm not saying don't trade this coin but if you believe in this project or think this is how a decentralized shitcoin should operate just kys. >>9911368
I was warning EOS fags about the fact that EOS was barely in beta phase when it ran on the ETH chain safely as erc20. I got responses like these, obviously it ain't November yet but it is already coming true. 

Greets to whoever the EOS retard was in that thread. >Mainnet chain paused for 3-6 hours if you didnt sell this on "mainnet" you are a brainlet >>9911461

It is a feature...you can pause the chain anywhere and anytime. Bullish as fuck >>9911915

What the fuck is wrong with the crypto market. >>9911970
Who cares about the tech? Basically nothing in decentralized anymore and everything is flawed with fatal codes >>9912027
Top 1% wallets is holding more than 90% of the coins right now. This shit will forever he overvalued as fuck. The majority of reputable person in the crypto person is in favor of EOS

PS: Not holding a single one of this shitcoin >>9911737
>>9911737

There's nothing wrong with this, it happens. Just didn't happen on ETH because it's a copy of BTC with a few changes to allow for smart contracts, BTC had moments like this too when it started.
If the software run by nodes is faulty then a decentralized chain can 'pause' until the software is fixed.

Even ethereum having plasma + sharding, and all other chains like Zilliqa, NEO etc WILL NOT reach over 10k viable TPS anytime soon. Maybe ethereum might start doing over 10k in year 2030 and still even 100kTPS is not anywhere near enough for numerous comercial scale DAPPS like a facebook or a twitter, because of the number of transactions in votes, posts, retweets, etc... Not to mention paying fees for every transaction is retarded and the EOS model is much more ideal.

EOS will scale to over millions of TPS with interchain communication within paralel chains.

All you ETH fags will be fomoing when the VCs start pushing out project after project and the demand for EOS skyrockets. It's not that you don't believe in EOS, it's that you don't want to understand the DPOS BFT model. There's 200 BPs and stand-by nodes not to mention validator nodes so the 21 BPs actions are heavily monitored.

DPOS has been seen working on Steemit, Bitshares, Ark, Lisk. EOS is made by the inventor of DPOS, look at Dan Larimers track record.

Only weak hands and brainlets are dropping their coins right now.
Don't buy EOS on this dip, STAY POOR >>9912256
>EOS will scale to over millions of TPS with interchain communication within paralel chains.

Sorry your chain is paused right now. Stay tuned. What are we going to do with the latest failed generation? The arrogance of ignorance on this board demonstrates pic related is true.

It won't be posted on biz right away, but I'm sure someone will leak it shortly after the email is sent out. Some of you have already given your emails in my 2 day thread. If you missed the chance, send me an email and I'll add you to the list.

Everyone fudding 0xbitcoin is just mad because they didn't listen to biz when it was being shilled here at $0.08 cents. 
It's still only a $5.6mil market cap which is plenty of room to grow. While everything continues going down, 0xBitcoin will continue going up. Don't listen to the pajeet pump and dump fud. It's fake. Only a nolinker would ask a question this dumb zilliqa, fusion and block collider

OK. Can you be more specific? What don't you like? The game could be made more complex with additional costs, so you have Jew counters to get rid of, and paper money which you pay to get rid of them? So machine gunning them kills more, but costs more (expensively bullets) whereas working them to death kills fewer but is cheaper? Much like Trump broke Hillary....crypto broke me. It broke me....

Wtf is going to happen when Bitcoin crashes people have been saying this shit will moon for a year now. truth is you're desperate fucks who've been holding onto one of the worst performing alts of the past 6 months. your in denial if you think ark v2 will give you anything other than a 10% pump followed by a subsequent harder dump, just like everything else they've released. face it arktards, even though it appears like a solid project, this one just ain't a money maker.

you didn't listen In my opinion ARK hodlers are in the late-DigiMarine stage. They rarely make threads anymore and have all but given up hope. >>9909601

Released on test net, not on main net. 

Soon, people and companies will be able to deploy their own blockchains easily with just a few clicks. They can then use whatever programming language they want to create smartcontracts on ARKvm, that are able to communicate with every other blockchain outside of ARK trough smartbridging. 

This thing is going to disrupt the entire cryptosphere. I've been buying ARK every single dip. ARK has been laying the groundworks for about a year now... you can't help but laugh at /biz/ kiddies when their coin doesn't moon within a few days or so. 

Be smart /biz/. >>9909642
I got here last month when everyone was telling me 30k was the absolute bottom, because of the v2 release. I'm not sure I can hold on any longer. >>9909643

we're literally accumulating. I never make ARK threads because of that reason alone. 

10K ark and counting. Buying another 200 today. >>9909654
>Soon, people and companies will be able to deploy their own blockchains easily with just a few clicks. They can then use whatever programming language they want to create smartcontracts on ARKvm, that are able to communicate with every other blockchain outside of ARK trough smartbridging. 

This seems misinformd? To my understanding ARK is in Javascript and most smart contracts are done in Solidity. ARK is lower than it has been in a really long time.

I bought 500 dollaroos worth was it a good or bad decision >>9909659
No offense but who the fuck are you? We used to have those chang and moonman guys posting their ARK threads every single day here. ARK is done. >>9909667
That's because you're right. ARK has APIs , but theyre a bit weak and the chain forks constantly. >>9909708

ARK is done... just fuck of brainlet. They haven't even completed development yet. I'll never sell, good luck changing my mind.

Ark is one of the greatest, if not, THE greatest crypto project out there

Nice try folks The thing with ark I don't understand is how many people out there actually NEED to deploy their own blockchains and for what reason? Maybe some particular companies might see a need for it but a regular person? It's not like building a fucking blog. They're branding themselves as the WordPress of blockchains but once the ICO fad is over nobody will really give a fuck. Only a niche segment of people will utilize this in the end. 

not to mention that if somebody does build something on the ARK ecosystem they have no need to actually use the Ark token. they can just make one themselves.

So, logically, where is this going beyond the speculative hot potato game? >>9909772

People said that about every single new technology that was ever released. Internet, Cell phones, Computers, everything... 

Blockchain hasn't seen anything yet. >>9909758
Sell to buy the dips fucking dipshit. You could’ve doubled your stack easily. >>9909601
Why do all these french shitcoins with amazing fundamentals fail so miserably? >>9909772
I used to think this too, but it's wrong. First I'd like to clarify the misconception that the ARK token is useless. It's literally the opposite. If you look at ARK as an ecosystem (which they are building), the ARK coin is the one that connects all the dapps and sidechains in the ecosystem. You use ARK to interact with everything inside and outside the ecosystem. This is very valuable, because each dapp gets the capabilities of other dapps. If you can't imagine scenarios where this is extremely useful for both developers and users alike, I can't help you. 

The second issue you raised is about the NEED. Who needs blockchains and will they ever go mainstream? Well lets think for a second. What do blockchains do best? Eliminate trust and are censorship resistant. This can fix all kinds of logistics problems and streamline so many processes that would end up saving people hundreads of billions or probably trillions of dollars. Imagine a scenario where half of the world uses blockchain as backbone for different business processes and logistics and the the other half doesn't. The half that doesn't will soon realize how inefficient their process is and will switch to blockchain solutions. It's not a matter of "NEED" but a matter of making things easier, faster and cheaper, which a free market loves. Sure, we lack oracles now that would help this immensely, but we're getting there. 

Here's another example that I like to give. When ARK is done with their roadmap, it will provide the best sandbox for developers to experiment with blockchain based apps. How long do you think it will take until some turboautist comes with a breakthrough dapp that will rival Google or Facebook in the next 10-15 years. When that happens, wouldn't you like to own part of the infrastructure that made it possible? 

Sure you can say we're speculating now, but it's speculation backed by facts and probability. ARK is the only project in the cryptosphere that actually thought this through. >>9909601
>That volume

The reason it is still dumping is because everyone is dropping their bags to jump in something that will recover quick and then buy back. Why you wouldn't do this is beyond me. >>9909850

They're not. You're just standing too close to the painting to see the bigger picture. A new technology takes two decades to get fully integrated into society. 

Those people who are now btc millionaires bought them at a few cents or dollars years and years ago. The ones who stand to lose are those ADD kiddies that expect their coin to +5000% within 12 months or so. >>9909878
Tron made me half a million In 3 months >>9909906

I bought back in November. Invested $4100 into Tron. You can do the math. Highest portfolio value was on January 4th at about $600k and I was at Texas Roadhouse with my parents. I sold later on that week. You want my order history from liqui anon? I got time l, just got back from a club. >>9909963
I believe you, and good for you. I still don't understand what this has to do with the topic at hand. You getting lucky with a random chinkcoin doesn't qualify you to give trading advice to that other anon and it also doesn't qualify you to find the next hyped coin that will do x100. Everyone's a genius until he gets burned. Case in point, me: caught 3 consecutive x10 missions and could have been a millionaire just from from 1000$. At the last x10 I held for a little longer and it crashed to shit suddenly. Still holding bags. >>9909727

? wtf your on about. not only weak but also confused fud >>9909667

ark core is in javascript. most smart contracts are done in solidity because most smart contracts are deployed on Ethereum fuckboi. However ark supports 16+ programming languages for developers and is porting everything Ethereum has but with DPOS ofcourse. 

the boy was right. Ark is going to disrupt everything. people dont want to listen, they dont want to buy. fine. ark has enough reserves to continue development. dont come complaining when your babbies first coin becomes neigh useless overnight though this is a shit coin....bancor is over us....its time to sell you guys >>9909772

What is confused? It's also not FUD? All factual. >>9909708
Threads arent made because the community has settled on the discord server. >>9910065

when does the chain fork constantly? You mean when push deployables are ready? Ark also does interoperability, theyve thought everything through already, they are three steps ahead than everything else out there.

hence why they take their damn time ensuring the fundamental codebase is god-tier. V2 now on testnet you can see for yourself how it compares with other developer platforms KEK.

>followed by smart contracts
>and push deployable blockchains (its already forkable with 10 minutes work but they want to make it instantly

That's what the VM is for. Porting over Solidity contracts to ARK. >>9910181

how far this bitch? while back you said POC >>9910192
Can't have gotten much farther in the last month... team is incredibly busy with v2.

Looking at the v2 code, it also looks like AIP11 is mostly done so the upgrade is ready for later this year that will actually make ARK useful and stand out from the other shitty Crypti forks. >>9909963
How did you make the decision to put that money in so early in tron? Was there some clue or...? >>9910201
So we can expect ark to be a basic product later this year? Assuming nothing goes wrong that is. Always got the impression the wallet and staking was done first and then product while other coins like eth are doing the staking after the product. Ark is going opposite of eth, which can be good but it seems to slow down people moving into it. >>9910201
>>9910243
please answer this guy, Moon. Even if you'd have to take a guess. A timeframe until a working product would be nice. >>9910201

AIP11? sorry im a programming brainlet. Is it something like CRAB17? >>9910065
>>9909727
ARK has APIs built into the nodes, most nodes use something like RPC and the API is done via a 2nd layer interacting with RPC. ARK has the API built in. The chain doesn't "fork constantly", it had one major issue with downtime earlier this week that was addressed in less than 3 hours (compared to the 12 hour complete LISK outage). 

You're definitely confused and clueless.

>>9910260
Big network upgrade that's coming after v2 - https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/AIPs/blob/master/AIPS/aip-11.md

>>9910243
Depends on your definition of product. The reason I'm in ARK is because it already satisfies my requirements of being a good product - it's the most decentralized coin thanks to DPoS, and it performs currency functions well. The major stuff I think it could have added is coming in AIP11. v2 was a major rewrite that fixes a lot of legacy bugs/fuckups from crypti.

Once AIP11 is out ARK is going to have better technology than the majority of coins out there. In terms of decentralization (the entire reason I'm in crypto in the first place) it's already there and getting better. By the end of the year ARK is going to be taken a lot more seriously and will be very far along, with VM being the only major feature missing.

In the meanwhile, I'm tasked with working on push button deployments for AWS and Google Cloud. Azure push button deployment is already out, and I'll be creating AWS/GCloud for v2 (and might port Azure as well for v2). >>9910285
I'll be honest holding since August 17 and im getting annoyed at their lack of progress. Put two devs on the deployer gui amd the rest on the VM port. Why would it take 6months+ to finish those two tasks? >>9910310
Who said it was gonna take six months?

The deployer is already done. You can launch a bridge chain with a simple command after cloning the deployer repo. Just needs a GUI for some customization options. >>9909963

No you didn't. >>9910285
Thanks this was really good explanation. >>9910221
The clue was Justin sun himself. Why would a pretty successful guy ruin his reputation by creating a “scam” coin? I knew it would blow up one day. Wasn’t expecting it so soon though. My current biggest investment is THEKEY. Reminds me of Tron back in the early days. This one will take longer. I got lucky and sold before the dump and rebought around 150-200 sats. A lot of bag holders on this one. >>9910324
You did
>By the end of the year ARK is going to be taken a lot more seriously and will be very far along, with VM being the only major feature missing.
>end of year
>still no VM >>9910343
>Why would a pretty successful guy ruin his reputation by creating a “scam” coin?
Lmao fuck off >>9910373
Oh you meant the VM.

They're porting the EVM. Why wouldn't it take a while? Writing software is harder than it looks, especially trying to port something as complicated as the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

v2 has a state machine which will already allow sidechains to have incredibly complicated code written write into the sidechain.

There's no reason the VM should be priority, it's a "fun to have" not a "must have". It will grab ETH market share and port "legacy" ETH code from Solidity, but ARK wants you to write your "contract" into the v2 core on your sidechain - that's what I'm going to be doing. Writing code for a VM is slower and not optimized compared to writing code native to the chain itself. >>9910285
>most nodes use something like RPC and the API is done via a 2nd layer interacting with RPC. ARK has the API built in.

Can you elaborate how it's more "built in" than another chain like Ethereum? >>9910376
Yeah yeah. Biz never changes does it. Time to go away for a couple more months. Stay poor anon >>9910343
Persona as a concept is better, whether that translates to a better useable product is another thing.
Mainets up, but they're dragging their feet namely with bounties & the mobile app. 
The mainnet is up, dpos forging happening. But they suffered an attack a few days ago, dont know if its been fixed. does mike doty still work on ark? if so what does he do? and if deployable chains are possible right now how come no one is deploying their own? >>9910387
>but ARK wants you to write your "contract" into the v2 core on your sidechain - that's what I'm going to be doing. Writing code for a VM is slower and not optimized compared to writing code native to the chain itself.

Holy misconceptions, Batman! I didn't know this and was under the impression that VM is a big deal and necessary for smart contracts, when actually it's not. I'm getting harder now. Sticky this. >>9910398
Persona is shit, stay the fuck away from it.

They ripped Chang's hacky bandaid and stuck in their mainnet without testing, now any bridgechain or sidechain testing locally will be completely fucking broken.

https://github.com/PersonaIam/persona-mainnet/commit/248e08c5667950d210eba8ae2900282d3ea975ba

Don't pull emergency patches that have barely been tested into your mainnet. BAD FUCKING IDEA.

>>9910395
Most crypto nodes (including ethereum) only run a JSON RPC API by default, not a REST HTTP one. This is crucial to getting developers on board as you don't need to setup an ARK node and layer your own REST API on top of it to get started working with the chain directly. >>9910402
They have 
Persona, blockpool, kapu, eductx & cesaire
Delegates will be deploying their projects using ark as will the team. At least another 5 more to come >>9910387
Ok, you've settled my fears for now. Still would like a few more devs, they should hire you. I know theyve added a fair number over the last 6-8months but still, the reliance on Faust is strong. >>9910425
I'm not sure if you're ignorant or what, but Infura has been a thing since before ARK even had a blockchain. >>9910453
You're confusing 3rd party APIs relying on outside infrastructure with node provided direct API access. ETH does not come with a REST API. >>9910181

Comments like these are honestly my biggest buy signal. My answer to your question is: I don't know, but like someone said before: a lot of people asked this question too when it came to the internet. Why would a small company need it's own website? etc. I'm buying more. >>9910471
Sorry, I'm saying your argument doesn't make sense. Using Infura and using someone elses ARK node(which seems to be your argument?) is the same thing. >>9910285
>not being in crypto for the lambos 
>the absolute state >>9910489
Relying on a 3rd party requires that third party to constantly be on top of things and up to date, their service could be paid, they have to have constant uptime, it's not explicitly tied to any spec, etc.

With ARK nodes, you can simply select ANY node on the network and start querying it for data. Decentralization is the key. >>9910501
It's not actually a good idea to "decentralize" yourself from which nodes you're using as you're likely to "decentralize" into a bad peer. >>9910522
That's what cryptography is for. You don't need to trust the peer when you can verify the integrity of the data it provides instead. >>9910522
>>9910533
My central point here being that it isn't about trust since cryptography removes that problem - it's about availability and ease of use. >>9909601
thats not how it works.
big release or news ≠ price going up, it would be too easy to make money for the normies then.
same for stocks, apple stocks don't go up just because something new is announced or released >>9910501
this is key
also the reason I'm still invested in ark
can't wait for the hard fork to come >>9910285

youre a god. 

>mfw Moonman will liberate us from the jews >>9910402

+people are waiting for V2 code on mainnet before forking ofcourse. I sold half my stack a day before testnet was released. I'm left now with 2k. If it moons I'll be good to go, if not, fuck it. My biggest concerns are also: 1. how many companies need an own blockchain? 2. If it is mostly a b2b token there won't be much tradable volume by normies. 3. If it moons like ether the market cap inflation through staking will be ridiculous and not sustainable.
I hold for the mooshot as the idea and tech is good. But I'm certainly not putting in more than I'd be willing to lose on this one. It says 78% complete. >>9910723
>If it moons like ether the market cap inflation through staking will be ridiculous and not sustainable >>9910723

1) everyone. thousands of businesses. now wait until there will be a few nice gems, good applications and dapps running on their own free blockchain from ark. once there will be a nice ecosystem ark will glue it together. bridge it. exchange it. 

2) no trade volume will allways be low, people rather buy and stake than trade

3) eth also has inflation, a lot actually. staking inflation goes down relatively the longer mainnet is up. >>9910800
the guy had 4k ARK without doing minimal research to see ARK's inflation rate. He's below a brainlet. >>9910723
>>9910817

just look how many erc20 projects are running on Eth. But its ridiculous to have everything running on a single blockchain. its ONE railway, even if its a maglev it cant handle being the platform for say the entire world. by next year everyone will have adopted Ark's mutliblockchain outlook. Every dapp its own blockchain.

the next cryptokitties wont run on eth, it will run on a private fork from ark. This is a 4 year hodl my friend. Accumulate I can tell Ark is a buy because every thread gets very technical. 

If all the people with tech understanding are discussing a project...it's gonna win. 

Normies with no understanding discuss Tron and other normie fuckboy projects that will ultimately fail. >>9911791

Not trying to FUD Ark because I love the project but good tech doesn't always come out on top.

I kind of agree with you though and I do hold a decent amount of Ark myself. Always important to DYOR on every project you're invested in. >>9911929
Agreed >>9911426 >>9912133
I made this photoshop and I did it as a meme. I actually hold ARK too. >>9911791
What have you been smoking? I'm on biz 24/7, ark threads go like this:
>buy ark! TRUST ME it's going to moon
There is zero technical discussion ever. If I just read biz I still wouldn't know what it does. >>9912146

As an Arkie, i love the deluded meme...it's going to make the ARK's departure so much better. We'll be standing on deck, waving goodbye to all the sinners, drowning in a sea of useless shitcoins. Oh my brothers, we will experience a level of smugness reaching far beyond our current levels of delusion. >>9912189
Scroll up maybe? 

Or maybe you just have Jamal level reading skills We're all be dead by the time this does anything. 
At least our children will live a wealthy life with our Ark investments. Right? >>9912201
Someone should start making an "enlightened Arkies" set of pics with the other Nep hi /biz/

I made some gains with crypto back in 2017 and I bought an apartment with that. Now, I live in and... what to do?

Just playin game till the end of time? I'm in great shape, great mood but I feel somehow empty. I don't need anymore to gain money or whatever, and I don't need a gf after I dumped the last one so /biz/ what to do with my life now? >>9911688
Rent out the apartment and become a slumlord >>9911709
what for? buy a bigger apartment?

This one is already too big for my use, I only stay in the main room and there is plenty of useless empty space bump >>9911688
Volunteer your time and money to a charity you believe in. The only way to fill that empty void in your heart is to give unconditionally. It's how one can start realizing true inner peace. >>9911755
Woah hol up, i'm never going to give money to anybody beside my mom. And I don't have so much, I used 85% of my gains for the apartment. That can't be a solution for my problem >>9911723
Rent it out and get a smaller one then. Use the extra income to pursue your goals. >>9911776
I just wanted to be comfy and now that's done I don't know anymore what are my goals or what I want to do with my time >>9911688
fuck off larping cunt. you are skint and will end up lower class for the rest of your life then end up killing yourself in your 40's. >>9911800
I'm not larping dude, i'm in my empty apartment right fucking now >>9911775
You mentioned a feeling of emptiness but this feeling can't be treated by acquiring more material things. You wanted to know how you could feel more fulfilled and I told you. There are other types of gains in life than money and property. >>9911813
You're probably right but somehow I don't feel concerned about this solution for the moment, but thanks again for the advice i'll consider it sooner or later I guess I just need a more addictive video game, or just an addiction in general to feel complete again. Stupid solution but nothing better come to my mind atm bump >>9911794
Whatever you have a passion for. If you are into cars then work on building one. If you are into film then make a movie. If you are into books then write one. If you like vidya then either learn to code or hire a coder to make you one, then market it. If you are into politics then start an organization. You have the free time to do anything you want. bump, need your advice to kill the void >>9911862
What would you do if you were in my position? >>9911863
You're also coming across as very needy right now and that might also be effecting your personal relationships >>9911688
I suggest traveling, there is alot to see in the world.
Also meet people with the same hobbies as yours. >>9911875
Well. I don't talk to anybody anymore so that's not a valid concern for the moment >>9911874
I'd try to start an animation studio and make non-pozzed cartoons for children. >>9911888
Thanks for the advice man, will consider it even if I traveled a lot in Europe and Asia when I was a young adult >>9911901
I'm starting a list with all these ideas about what to do, and on the paper launching a studio about whatsoever appeal me a lot >>9911874
I'd spend all my time learning programmimg cuz I'm curious. Already doing it during free time but would be nice if I can just focus on it 24/7 Pepellionaire, is that you?

Love,

Lain I'm an ex-graphic/web/motion designer btw, but I don't do that anymore. I tried to learn solidity but that's just too damn complex for me atm. Since that, I don't do shit >>9911930
Not me, sorry >>9911888
>travelling meme
Anon I... there's nothing interesting to see in the world, games, books and shows are much more interesting, in fact after spending a lot of times with them you realize how bleak, dull and worthless real world is >>9911964
For real? 
So what our goal is to make it(house etc) just so we would play games, read and watch shows all our life until we die? >>9911933
>animation, 3d rendering, day trading, programming 
these are about the only stuffs you can make a living at home with >>9911964
I don't agree, travel can be fun and worth your time if you're with some friends.

I did that years ago, 10/10 experience but I don't feel to do it atm.

Speaking about games, books and show, maybe you could do me a recommendations about your favorites >>9911984
I made my money by doing webdesign for stupid ico so yea I agree with u pal but no need to make money for me atm, just wanna feel ok >>9911978
If that's the case, then I just win life and let me tell you the endgame is kinda boring >>9911978
>making it = free to do what you want
in my case I want to be skilled at what I do so there will never be a case of "i dont know how to solve that problem". 

I will unironically continue wagecucking even if i make it, it doesnt have to be literally going neet >>9911688
They say if you look at a person's closest 5 friends and average their incomes together, your income will be close to that (average being the key word here, of course people deviate.) But the point is the same is true for happiness. If you aren't happy/fullfilled get some friends who are and start spending time doing shit with them. >>9912012
It cant be the endgame if your not content with life right?

I mean the endgame is to be content/happy right?
How do we do that? >>9912035
>>9912106
Thinking about this shit for 20minutes without any clues of a correct answer all the panic in low caps has been great for scalping profits in bear markets. some of the recent ICOs have dipped over 50-70% in the past weeks.

1) set super low buy orders
2) wait for big token holders panic sell
3) immediately put the tokens for sale 10-20% higher.
4) ????
5) PROFIT >4) Pray that the dump is over and some bigger fools buys your bags >>9911336
thats why you set the buy orders super low, there's usually deep peaks down when a big position wants a quick exit. >>9911320
which ico scraps >>9911320
ok OP you are using your brain so you are instantly in top 0.1% of biz but why do you think that you will EVER be able to sell it again, most of these never go up even for a day after being given up on >>9911389
i bought some BBO & EDR >>9911526
im not holding these coins for long. i know that 90% of the ICOs are shit (maybe more). 

I'm buying for the instant dump and then the market correction. You can see it often in the charts.

A few days ago I bought BBO for roughly 1950. It went back to 2300 within an hour or so. That's an easy 15%. Now that the crypto fad is over, whats going to be the next millenial foty? >>9912159

He just sold brother, he thought it was over.... pamp it. now. Monthly chart dosent look so good..

You thought we have had bearmarket past 6 months? Nope.. get ready for the real bearmarket! Wow, that looks horrific. fuck im selling ty just bought 100k Thats a bullflag you retard >>9911896

Well.. then we need to close june above 7500.. 
Hope you are right.. if not we will see 4400 pretty soon Bull flag bro >>9911931

Then 4400 will come anyways imo who the fuck reads charts on a monthly scale? >>9911896

If you go to discord they are actually against shilling to us fucks This is the easiest 10x I ever saw. Look at all the shitty BTC clones with 10x the marketcap then realize this is a decent BTC clone rather than a shitty one. Jesus christ /biz/ if you don't buy this you will unironically miss out.

>>9911700
Far from being a buzzword ico. Bear will last until end of Q4 2018. Anything more? >>9912162
Yeah bear will last until Q4 and then BOOM BULL NOW. I have an idea for a food product but NO money or resources. What should I do? the internet is so confusing share it here so we can laugh at your dumb idea. >>9912142
What kind of food product is it? You don't have to be specific, but we can't really help you without some information. Or you could just go see a consultant like a 30 year old boomer. >>9912142

Only capital, time and execution are. where my BAT-men at?

WHY IS BAT STILL GOING UP? RSI IS HIGH AS FUCK, IM SCARED >>9911636

1H RSI that is >>9911636
BAT MAN reporting in >>9911636
50k batman reporting in, still accumulating RSI is 77 on 4H candles so im expecting a dump soon, at least down to 0.000470 >>9911845

but fuck it just keeps pumping, are whales accumulating cuz they know coinbase soon? fuck this is hard, I sold at 0.000510 to swingtrade some >>9911636
It's going up because the first BAT ad trials start next week (tweeted by Brendan Eich.)

This means that we're gonna start seeing what kind of brands are already buying ad space with BAT. >>9911903

im selling these news no way this pump can sustain >>9911987
Also, at the end of June people are expecting BAT to be listed on coinbase pro Anyone not buying right now must hate money, any buy under $10 is a steal Seriously think there is insider trading. Last time this happened was a couple days before the dow-jones partnership. I don't think it's coinbase related cause ZRX would also be going up like when they announced erc20 support. Any thoughts? I want to buy more but I am worried about bitcoin ruining the party USD wise (sats wise I think it's a solid time). >>9912103
Ad trails start next week, could be advertisors buying BAT in preparation >>9912103

There is nobody left to sell BTC. Hodlers are going to do just that, hodl. Whales already cashed out 9k to 10k and are looking to buy back in. IF we go, we will never break 5. Buy now, layer down to 5k if it goes there (I doubt it). Also, the last big CME futures cycle closed at 6,200. Coincidence? Nope. All you have to do is watch these to know what's going to happen. When moon? Should I keep living at my moms house (she charges me $500/mo but I don't pay for food, internet etc) or should I move in to my dads empty apartment unit where I'd have to pay $650/mo + utilities ? I picked up a job paying $12.25/hr starting so I can put more fiat into crypto and into my FBA arbitrage. I have to decide by July 1st. >>9910101

Niggah stay at your mums. Your dads place will be fun and shit but those extra costs of living (food and other things you need) will fucking crush you and your $12.50/hr. Learn from my mistakes anon. >>9910101
If you have a job move out right now. Oh, and cut ties with your family while telling them they are the among the shittiest parents in the whole world. I get wanting to force your kid out of the basement, but charging him to stay is beyond sad. Yeah the extra costs add up, it could be over 1k+ at your dads. If it is worth it that much to you to move away from your moms (small house, no privacy, bothersome mother/siblings examples) persuade your father to reduce the rent. If it is decent at your moms, save money for crypto and look for a career.

Also wonder what kind of freelancing you do. Do you use upwork? >>9910127
Seconded, move out only if you have something to earn that compensates for that big increase in expenses(a lot bigger that the difference you mentioned if you add food and house expenses) >>9912047
Consider this, I don't know your situation, but try to do 50% of what you mom does to maintain the house. That is all time and money you'll have to pay on your own, you learn to min max with time, but it'll still take away a lot of your resources. I'd say contribute at least 50% of all that is done in the house that concerns you and don't skip out things once you are able to do that decide what to do, this way you'll risk nothing). Anything that you don't want to do or aren't able to will be money spent to have someone else do it for you. >>9912126
Actually you'd also have to roughly calculate expenses, 2600 a month would be a lot in some places. I know nothing about the cost of living where you are. Who else here getting absolutely and unequivocally GOOKED right now? Just bought one of these things, was I scammed? >>9912043

If the price of SKY continues going down, yes, you have been scammed.
Funny fact: original skywire images for orange pi primes are full of bugs that a system entirely build by yourself, with cheaper boards, would not have. But at least you would get whitelisted (if). I know it because retards complain about nodes being restarted regularly and I have never had that issue myself with my Opis Win Plus. >>9912181
>Funny fact
Did you mean fun fact? >>9912043
Yeah... you got ripped, kinda... I actually built 4 DiY miners (8 nodes each) for a little under $2k. Anyone else here just throw a little gambling money at crypto instead of their life savings? I put in like $20 a week, compared to the 50ish+ toward my traditional investment account. When I hit >150% I'll pull some out and put it towards muuuuuh student loans like a good goy.

I can't believe how much some of you have riding on crypto lol. I hope you all make it, but it's called "high risk" for a reason. >>9911646
anon a total of $70 a week can barely be considered investing. You're dealing with such small sums that it doesn't register that your allocations are terrible. >>9911646
for me it's simple. responsible investments in a traditional vehicle will provide me a slightly better life, but I'd still have to wage cuck my way to my 50s.
crypto may melt my money into shit forever, leaving me to cuck my life away with a shittier car and house than otherwise. but if i make it, the jew loses one work ant that will never ever move a muscle to create wealth for him. >>9911674
maybe he's living paycheck to paycheck and doesn't have anything else to spare >>9911674
15% of my income goes towards student loans, 10% towards long term savings and 10% to cash savings. 

Those are decent percentages, and more than most people are doing especially in my bracket. You seem out of touch with what most working people make in a week. what a sexy dude >>9911713

For ETH it would obviously be the DAO hack and fork. Brothers I have somehow managed to accumulate 4k link over the last 6 months. I'm from India so the extra wage cuck bucks cannot buy anything significant, if I went all in now I'd probably have 4.5k link why that's it. Instead I'm throwing in 50$ a month to day trade for meagre gains. How much time I have left, will I make it, feeling incredibly insecure with my stack which i think is halfway short. I envy you fucking mutts who can just throw in their monthly savings and get a 10k stack. Be thankful for it every single day. 

Anything around 1million usd after taxes is "making it" here Anons pls reassure this poor faggot >>9911328
Old money here worth more than half a mil . I did several hours research on Link. It's proposed service is redundant and already out-classed >>9911328
Link will go to 0, sir. Research ICNQ and buy from idex. >>9911348
Look i might be a pajeet but I understand tech better than most of these retards here lol, a single no substance comment won't do shit. Neither me, nor anyone else here who understands this will sell even a single link because of what you typed there >>9911372
No sir non retard pajeet here, try trick on proper retard pajeet >>9911328
You'll be fine. Think of it this way, you don't need LINK to get you a million dollars, but it can be the stepping stone to get you a nice stack, and if you're still following crypto and you pick the next thing nice and early, you'll well and truly make it.
I think $20 is an incredibly conservative mid-term estimate, and if you've managed to accumulate 5k by then that's $100k. Serious money to pick the next big coins.

t; 135k link bought in September, have completely transcended the fud and know more about this project than 99% of this current board. >>9911383
Right. If I ever get to 100k I'd definitely diversify into eth and monero, but definitely keep 50% or more in link. I'm just worried I may not be able to find another new project/ coin which is so promising that I jump in with 100% confidence

 Researching skycoin right now but very skeptical >>9911382
But sir, I try to help. Research before you diss >>9911376
Crypto as a thing is a dying fad coz no real world use demand >>9911398
I don't know of any other project that is as much of a slam dunk as link, but who knows what problems will arise as a result of actual smart contract implementation. As that happens you will see a whole bunch of ancillary services pop up, and if you understand the smart contract space to the extent that you see why link is insanely valuable, then you will probably get your head around the best approaches to the next set of problems too. >>9911328
Buy Mobius sir.
Klaus Schwab co-founder of the World Economic Forum helped them sign a contract for a decentralized oracle solution with BRICS.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS
Schwab even mentioned Mobius is his latest book titled "The Fourth Industrial Revolution".
Mobius is floating to new heights in the turbulent waters of the current cryptosphere. >>9911328
>I'm from India
So this whole thing is a Pajeet cult? >>9911432
Sirs >>9911425
With the possible mainstream adoption of smart contracts, one thing I can see being extremely useful is quantstamp (or something like it). But fuck quantstamp , they made their token useless by their selling services for USD and eth. 

with a 100k and Link already having mooned, I'd rather also want to look outside crypto coins/ tokens for investing >>9911448
That's SIR to you maggot.
Now flush yourself! >>9911432
Op knows pejeets better then most, why would you think he would buy this shit pejeet coin? >>9911462
Sorry honorable Sir ; Link $1000 eoy. Over n out >>9911328
sirs >>9911477
Poo!
When there's shit in the streets! >>9911512
YES YES YES ; $1000 eoy

The world runs on Sc soon >>9911460
Fair enough. Bear in mind I think selling LINK at $20 would be jumping the gun. I imagine it could go well over that. >>9911398
linklet here with 6.5k. dont worry fren there will always be a next big thing, our real problem is not being able to identify where the world is heading towards >>9911536
Let me show you where we're heading Mr President Sir.

You could go all in on LINK today. Or you could try something else. This outside money, you put 15-20% in BTC, 80-85% in USDT. You choose a day for the month, on that day for the next 4 months you take 15%-20 from USDT and you set some bids once each month until you run out of USDT. Why? Because your opinion on bottoms could change in the next months. Each month you try to distribute your folio as 25% on BTC, 25% on ETH, 25% on XLM and 25% on LINK (not counting whatever remains on USDT). Why these coins? I can’t remember. After 4 months, you can all in your USDT funds and try to remodel your portfolio 5% each month .To something like 22.5%/22.5%/25%/30% or 26.6%/26.6%/26.6%/20.2% or something else and keep changing it each month. Also if you haven’t done it up to this point, consider moving some funds outside of exchanges. Four months later you can start working on weeks then you can choose how many weeks to think about days... My portfolio doesn't look like what I’m telling you but this game isn’t about making it accumulating enough Fiat currencies, that’s for poor pajeets, forever shitting on the street. > weak hand are out of this market I fucking hope so. The sooner (((they))) believe that weak hands are out of the market, the sooner they will prep the bull. let's fucking hope so! WHY DON'T YOU LISTEN >>9911039

You realise binance is launching their dex in a matter of months.... >>9911265
Don't buy then anon ;) >>9911039

It's not "another dex", you fucking newfag. It's the first true dex. The first true wallet to wallet atomic swap, no coloured token dex. The first ACTUAL dex. Fucking Binance, lmao. Blocknet literally performed the first ever atomic swap. They are legit as absolute fuck. >>9911287
Let us depart from this thread. My love for biz will force me to make another anyway...keep accumulating anon and may all good gains come to you :) >>9911287
You under estimate how many people actually care about that fact >>9911433

Sure, let me just see your list of experience first... >>9904145
what can you do? i've been looking for a job for 6 months straight, sent out hundreds of applications and have had like 25 interviews, still jobless :)

i've decided to just start studying towards a diploma starting in July since i don't have any skills worth paying for currently. i guess i'll find a part time job with 20-30 hrs a week while i'm studying that fulltime, that should be much easier to find compared to a fulltime job. i don't really see any other option >>9904261
Nice pic. Mind if I save it? >>9904261
you're hired >>9904273

just become a tradesman bro >mechanical engineer
>still no job one year after graduating >>9904285
was thinking about it buy idk how to get started. i don't want to just start as a simple labourer for a few years and see where that takes me because i need to start working on a skillset now. do i just go to tradeschool or something? >>9904313

Show me your resume and I can tell you exactly what you're doing wrong. Or send it to me at turnip@waifu.club >>9904313

Pick a trade. Get some work experience. See if a tradie will give you a week or 2 unpaid work experience so they can show you what the jobs about. If you like it start trade school or apply for those jobs. Guy you do work experience with wil be an industry contact too Have you considered starting a milk farm? >>9904273
Have also been looking for a better job as the organization I'm employed at clearly doesn't have much upward opportunities for me. Skipped out on a few possible opportunities too. Now my only job opportunity is a garbage internship when I could've gotten a better job in the same field out of state. >>9904354
Here it is.
>inb4 no internships
Couldn't get one of those either so I did undergrad research.

>>9904370

This might be bad advice, but I would teak how you list your awards. Second and fourth place might be a huge achievement, but when that's listed first, kind of gives a feel of "welp, he's not the best". Apart from that don't just send a stock resume, but tailor it for the place you apply. Instead of putting generic things to describe your previous experience, focus on the aspects of these jobs that would help you in the in the one that you're applying to. In a lot of cases, references don't need to be there, you can just write that they're available on demand (but I guess it doesn't really hurt to have them there from the start, just doesn't really change much.) Also, in addition to your resume, make sure that in your presentation letter you explain why you fit what they're looking for and tick every damn boxes of their job offer, explaining exactly you qualify for these things (cover everything, but be as concise as possible; keep it brief). >>9906415

Alright I drank a little whiskey let me see what I can help you with.

>Experience goes first - ALWAYS
>Remove references, they will ask for them
>Remove everything you did in high school 
>Projects/Experience are a bit convoluted. Narrow it down to three of your most relevant for the position. 
>Why is your contact information split up in 4 quadrants
>Use your bullet points to sell yourself, how does best team from the united states tell them anything about your skills?

Do you not have any internships? It all seems like course work. Do your best to use keyword optimization when applying for a posting. >>9904273

wait how are you jobless after having 25 interviews? I've been applying for jobs at banks to do KYC
haha can you imagine people getting paid 6 figures just to google peoples addresses and names haha >>9908662

After talking with other graduates who had a rough time after graduating it feels like it was a combination of economy, undeveloped CL writing skills, and basic job experience. Don't be afraid to throw yourself at a shit megacorp sort of in your field for that sweet 6-12 months of experience to land a better job. When doing so, try to find places that are expanding and as such are hiring in bulk. LMFAO at all you fucking bizlet retards with litearlly 0 education or college falling for this troll post.

I was thinking about becoming an actuary or a financial adviser. I don't know much about either of those things, but like I said I like learning new things. Both jobs require you to pass exams. I could study for the exams between now and then but I don't want to put all my eggs in one basket.

Help me out with some ideas bros? I want to earn enough to support my family comfortably and not hit a wage ceiling.

Wife has a masters in Economics so I am sure she will find a good job. Or at least I hope. People are fucking selling at 20% profit, it's like 20% is the new 10x. What the fuck is going on?

Find the next big thing. Don't ask me what it is though >random shitcoin X no longer going up 300% when devs release news about Ethiopian Language Pack

oh no I'm thinking the real crypto bottom will be in September October, we'll see. >>9911286
nope, sold when we were doing unsustainable 300% gains a day, like a person with a brain.

how do i short this You are all so hopelessly retarded. Why in the fuck would you want to jump on the bandwagon of a coin that WELCOMES ASIC MINERS with open arms.

You're all so dumb. How do you think BTC ended up so centralized? Stupid fucking ASIC miners. Terrible algorithm. What a bunch of complete retards. The only people buying this, don't understand how it is mined, don't understand why it costs GWEI to even mine the piece of shit, and a plethora of other reasons to stay clear the fuck away from it. (Oh and also half of the ETH on the order book is one guy, and you can confirm this on etherscan... once he pulls his orders down, this thing will crash so fucking hard.

I would feel sorry for you idiots if you didn't outright deserve to lose your money. You jump from scam to scam. Linkfags, owned. Eos fags, owned. 0xBTC fags are next. >>9911967
>Eos fags, owned. 0xBTC fags are next.

EOS and 0xBTC, kek. I'm flattered if you think there are similarities. > “The smartest thing you’ve done is not have ‘bit’ or ‘coin’ in your name. I’ll tell you another story that is underreported, but worth paying attention to. Bitcoin is really controlled by China. There are four miners in China that control over 50% of Bitcoin. How do we know that China won’t intervene? How many countries want to use a Chinese-controlled currency? It’s just not going to happen.”

Ich liebe darüber zu reden wie man in den Markt shorten kann und wie genial ich bin von solch brillanten Ideen zu schreiben, wie man ein Maebbie Bär ist und shortet hehe! Ich liebe, wie shorten sogar von der Technologie unterstützt ist. Shorten ist die neue Ära! Ich werde auf immer und ewig shorten ;) Ich habe schon die ganze zeit BTC geshortet. Ich habe es anderen beigebracht und meine Nachbarn und Kollegen sind jetzt auch alle am shorten des Markts und wir machen alle mega viel Geld zusammen mit dem shorten von BTC und Ark . Ich bin super beliebt in meinem Freundeskreis, weil ich so viel Geld von dem shorten des Markts gemacht habe; viele machen jetzt dank mir Konten bei bitmex auf. Ich kann es kaum erwarten zu sehen wie der Bärmarkt für die nächsten 5 Jahre anhalten wird bis ich genug Geld vom shorten gemacht habe, um mir ein Haus zu kaufen und hoffentlich noch ein Auto dazu. Shorten ist garantiert der beste weg langfristig Geld zu machen. Opened a short at 7600 and closed it at 6500

it really is rat poison squared bump Can you short alts against usdt on finex? Should I study Economics or Business Administration ? forget studying and go straight to welfare Why not both? Economics is very interesting but business administration will get you into a job faster I assume. You can study a lot of Economics by yourself, use the principles later on to build your business. >>9910559
Study both ? It will be like 12 semester >>9910570

I studied Economics on the side for 3-4 years next to college classes (and still am 5 years later) just because I have a huge interest in the matter. Granted, you won't be getting a degree, but the general knowledge, even the bare basics will help you in your Business Administration tracks. The reverse of going to school for Economics and learning Business Administration is quite a bit harder. >>9910543
Study a combination of IT and Business anon.. these can't work together unless there is like a bridge between them.. be that bridge >>9910626
>learning business admin harder than Econ 
You must be fucking kidding Business administration all the way. And I agree with >>9910693 - mix it up with a bit of VBA and C# and you will never have any fear of being underpaid or even unemployed. >>9910700
Mainly depends on the university. I met brainlets with a phd in economics that would never had gotten a undergrad in theater science in a decent university. Mathematics or Engineering.
Economics and it's predictive models are a scam. >>9910700

Never implied it was harder.
Certainly more interesting than business administration.

>>9910709

Skip boring economics and skip to behavioral economics.
Tversky/Kahneman/Taleb..(perhaps). >>9910709
>Math or engineering
STEM is a meme. Without a phd, experience and recommendations, my company would not even invite someone for an interview from this field.

BA or economics land you a job even with an average undergrad degree. >>9910543
Study the blockchain >>9910737
Which one would you prefer ? BA or economics >>9910737
What are you smoking, I did a summer internship and got a job after graduating. I did comp sci/EE

>>9910730
Economics are fun but they are just wrong, just get capital and start trading and learning from heuristics like Taleb says. >>9910743
I would prefer BA, but already having a degree might make my decision somewhat biased here.

However, not just BA and absolutely not marketing. Go with something not many do, like controlling and add learning how to code and handle databases a bit. You dont need to master it, just the basics are okay. 

This is basically the golden ticket in this field, as seemingly no one can do this. >>9910743
>>9910771
No top tech firms hire BA's though, you will get stuck in some trash company bullied by unions. >>9910751
> just get capital and start trading and learning from heuristics like Taleb says.

Well that is what I am doing. Taleb has been one of my biggest influences when it comes to understanding Economics. He does lend a lot of from Tversky and Kahneman when it comes down to Heuristics. 

Some Taleb wisdom on trading:

>I got a job after graduating
Consider yourself very lucky.
In law and STEM, we have so many applications for a single position, HR sorts out anyone without a phd, before even looking at anything else.

However, it might have to do with the country. >>9910778
>No top tech firms hire BA's though, you will get stuck in some trash company bullied by unions.

Then I ask myself, which finance department I am deputy head of for about two years now with "just" an undergrad in finance. We are market leaders in several med-tech fields. >>9910780
Yeah
>He does lend a lot of from Tversky and Kahneman when it comes down to Heuristics.

I'm not denying he does, but those people didn't study Economics is what I'm saying, they were both psychologists/mathematicians IIRC. >>9910751
>just get capital and start trading

I am a bit amazed, that this even gets discussed here.
The /biz/ from 2015 would have roasted you for even thinking making a living out of trading. >>9910869
Why? Mid term trading strategies work fine. >>9910730
This.
Behavioural Ecinomics / Socioeconomics / Agent-centric modelling / Economic Anthropology and Blockchain Economics — if you want to have fun, satisfaction and employability at the same time. >>9910885
Because the amount of money needed, to make enough money in mid-term investments to live from the gains is actually not low enough to make this a "get capital"-issue but a "have capital"-issue.

From what I understand, someone could be tempted to get credit from a bank for it. Which in turn is a very bad idea. >>9910931
I agree then. I was thinking in terms of already having capital.

Still doing some retail investing while doing a STEM degree tends to be a good idea since if you wanna apply yourself to work as a trader at a firm you can add your "private portfolio management" experiences to the CV. I work in tech and they appreciated that I did some stuff like that in my spare time. >>9910543
I will be coming back to this thread because I have the exact same dilemma >>9911137
Study BA then, Economics are mostly a scam especially in Keynesian departments. >>9910543
Go for Business Administration. In fact, it would be better if you take any trade offered by trade schools over Econ just because of jobs available. >>9911081
I am not so sure that this is so beneficial. With a STEM degree and experience in investing/trading, the best thing when you want to use both of these fields, is trying to become a specialized industry analyst. With a background in math/physics, maybe a quant trading company is interesting, but then again your own retail investment experience matters very little, as this is a complete different operational field.

And even as an analyst, I dont see the issue to be different. There is an abundance of STEM graduates to chose from and the information you are required to provide there is also heavily focussed on the tech, which has nothing to do with your experience as a retail investor. >>9910543
if you study economics, you'll probably get forcefed a unit on marx because "oooooooaah but he had an iq of 600 million and his ideas were so influential!!!!"
imagine helping to create a system that killed over 100 million people because it is so numb to objective truths about how humans operate and then being celebrated for it to the point where your economically illiterate piece of shit critique of the single greatest thing ever to happen to the civilized world and to benefit the rest of the world as a result is taught as a valid and functional set of arguments and objective truths, always getting the benefit of "not being real communism!" from everyone when it fails, whereas when the system that it opposes is blatantly taken over in countries that it made extraordinarily wealthy and happy and advanced and replaced with anti-free-market rules and borderline socialist taxation, educated morons are still begging for what little remains of it to be destroyed because they don't understand that the corporatocracy that they live in was what was prevented by capitalism for well over a hundred years, and was enabled by socialist practices >>9911600
Uh, edgy fagging. >>9910543
If you study economics youre going to learn a lot of theory and no real world applications. If you study business admin you will be a good cog in a company after that company spends 3 years unlearning all the stupid shit college taught you. If you start a business you will learn on the fly and probably have better success and certainly sooner than if you wasted money "studying"

Do you know why companies like PHD and other applicants with long college careers? Sure they may have the knowledge and ability, but so may the guy on the street. The degree shows that the applicant has the character to stick it out and see things through. What companies value more than anything is commitment. They know that most intelligent people can adapt to learn anything so they want people with the personality to stay with a company after they have apent time and resources training you. Find a major exec or a large company's head of HR and they will tell you the same if theyre honest It literally doesn't matter what degree you do. I did an economics degree then worked in banks and a law firm. But it really doesn't matter. Experience is what matters, not your degree, But you need some type of degree to get a job, but you don't need a specific degree to get most jobs. Just any degree. >>9910543
It depends on what career you want. Late game, you'll be better off with a bachelor's in economics and an MBA. But a business admin major will have an easier time in the early portion of his career. A lot of it also depends on your career goals. I've noticed that econ majors seem to be good better at finance than business, management, and accounting majors.

Economics classes tend to stick with the neoliberal "perfect middle of capitalism and socialism" mantra. I'm a Third-Position Corporatist, yet didn't find much propaganda in the textbooks. You might get the occasional rant about women in the workplace or global warming, but it's still far more technical than the other social sciences.

The real propaganda in universities is their social theories. The idea of "the proletariat defeating the bourgeois" doesn't work too well when your followers are all middle-class kids who had everything handed to them by their neoliberal families. But the idea of blacks being oppressed by whites, or gays by straights, or women by men, is the perfect way to divide a society. Their main goal is to try and instill that revolutionary proletarian spirit rather than sticking with any specific group vs group conflict. If you don't show your full powerlevel and just come off as a levelheaded conservative then you'll be find. In general, you'll only find trouble if you go looking for it. >>9911726
HR is literally next door to my office.
It really is just because there are a metric fuckton of phds on the streets in these fields and there is little to no reason to hire someone with a degree below that. We literally have a phd-count in our annual report, because it looks nice for the shareholders. >>9911752

Turned 10k into 1.5MM back into 600k in 14 months, which sucks, BUT I did successfully cash out a total of 450k during that time, paying about 200k of that in taxes (paid 110k last year, and will owe 90k this year assuming I don't take out more).

I have 50k in my checking right now, so what did I do with 200k?

I went traveling all over the world, going on "whore-cations". I've fucked over 100 escorts, ranging between $200-$2000 dollars (rarely would I fuck girls between $800-$2000 range, fucked a couple of pornstars that cost 2k).

I went all around the world fucking and eating and seeing shit I wanted to see. It's been an incredible fucking year, honestly. I'm 27 years old, and I suppose I could have invested the money in some shitty condo, but I decided to blow it all on myself, which really made up for my shitty early 20s where I worked all the time. I'm a line cook, so I quit my job when I first hit it big with DGB last may and it'll be easy for me to find a job when I want to.

I fucking love life, life is so good when you have money, but at the same time this hedonistic year really chilled me out. I no longer crave pussy and spend my time chasing girls, I've literally fucked enough amazing hookers that I actually want to spend my time improving my mind and body instead of chasing women. I think everyone needs to do what I did, spend a year doing literally whatever the fuck you want.

Anyways, AMA. 27 year old line cook with 50k in the bank and 600k in crypto who spent 200k last year traveling and fucking whores and eating the best food on earth. What porn stars? 450K

Cool dream op Nice dude. If I made it I think I would do something very similar and just fuck tons of insanely hot hookers.

Where did you travel and which cities did you monger?

How did you arrange fucking a pornstar?

Now that you're home, do you crave fucking hookers or are you over it and want to settle with a regular girl? >>9907450
Congrats bro but holy shit I wouldn't pay 2k to fuck those lumps of plastic. How much would it cost to fuck a porn qt like Mia khalifa or Riley Reid? Wait a minute these are actually dudes? If that is the case then I'm gay >>9907461
>Cool dream op

Not really, a couple of porn star surgery monsters and the idea of paying a lot of women who hate you to sit on your cock. Sounds like a 14 year olds idea of money 350K US is nothing. >>9907500
they all look better than the pornstars op paid to fuck. >>9907468
For whores, Prague (the best), Germany (second best), Montreal, Thailand, and Taipei (close third).

As for just traveling, went all around Europe and Asia, and Morocco for a little bit.

Booked Amber directly via email, Nicole through a service.

I'm actually just craving a regular relationship now. After getting all my dirty fantasies of fucking hordes of women out of the way, I've realized it's not a good life to live like a bachelor forever. It actually made me want to settle down and get my life on track, which leads me to believe that most people are chronically unfulfilled, which is why our world and political system is so shitty. If everyone was honest with themselves and tested their limits, they might be able to, at least see, what the real path to happiness might be for them.

I did something similar in 2016 except only for 6 months and I only fucked like 20 hookers but I traveled all over the world. It was by far the best experience of my life but I kinda regret it cuz the crypto boom happened shortly after I got back and I had already blown all my money. Now I'm a poorfag with only $70k in crypto but hoping I can turn that into $500k in the next 2 years so I can go traveling again. I'm 30 and honestly have zero desire to buy a house, get married, all that domestic bullshit. I just want to keep traveling and visit every fucking corner of this planet. >>9907546

Blew through 120k. Worth every penny. I spent most of my time in Asia, and s lot of time in Philippines because I really love bareback sex with 18 year old girls. Nothing better on planet earth than teenage pussy untainted by latex or birth control. >>9907732

Posts like this make me sad, but also serve as a fresh reminder of what is important to people - and how different that can be from person to person. I do agree that it's important to take time to enjoy yourself, but for others reading I'd like to say it doesn't necessarily have to be reduced to utter hedonism and whoremongering. 

I'm an ancient fag from moot days that was lucky enough to get into crypto very early. Zeroed out my grad school debt, real estate, taxman, nice car, helped out various family members - and like you, traveled all over the world (still do often) in order to eat the best food everywhere and soak up local cultures- though I do this with my wife (of 10+ years). 

Not to sound too much like a boring moralfag, but for others reading - it's also pretty cool to just get your shit together and adult-the-fuck out of life. And OP, happy to hear it sounds like the year has chilled you out, your mind and body will appreciate some renewed 'me time.' 

>pic is a menu I saved from Gaggan - which I figured you'd appreciate, generally considered the best restaurant in Asia - since I know you faggots presume this is a larp, it isn't

Gaggan has a really unique take on molecular gastronomy since he infuses so many 'Asian' flavors in his dishes - quite different than your typical modernist joints (think Le Chateaubriand, Baume, or Atelier Crenn) that take their cues from European fare. If you're into fancy food and will be in Bangkok its worth a reservation for sure! 

Also - Thailand protip, most tourists go south to the beaches. Head north! Places like Chiang Mai / Chiang Rai are awesome in my opinion and you get to see a different take on street food (Khao Soi!) Lol stop reading at 10k to 1.5mil

I don't know if it's legal in Taipei but it seems like it. A lot of the prostitutes are from China but they're pretty hot and work HARD. The girls were overall better looking in Prague and Europe on average for your dollar, but the best service I received was in Taipei.

Aren't you afraid of herpes?

>>9907742
Honestly, I would mostly mouth fuck them/get blowjobs. I'd do vaginal or anal only if they looked very clean. Test last month and I'm clean. I was really only worried about herpes, and not so much genital but oral (genital is worse, but oral is on your face). So no kissing or keep it to a minimum. HIV is hard to catch as a straight guy.

I just did EMP 3 months ago, which is considered the best restaurant in the world this year. Fine dining is absolutely worth it, but so are whores. If I ever get married I'll probably still get sucked off from time to time. There's going to be a time in any relationship where the woman stops sucking your cock well/with enthusiasm, if she even did to begin with. I don't ever want to lose that. I want to do something similar if my portfolio takes off. I had 300k peak, held through and am at 70k sadly. My only questions were if it was worth it and if you'd want to start a family after all that, since you've basically answered that i'll ask how you've transitioned into a regular lifestyle again and what are you doing to on a regular basis? Also what's you'e ideal girl (since you talk about a regular relationship) >>9909145
Ok well, last year I went to 10 different countries, but I just sort of "hung out" in the cities without any major plans. My only plans were going to famous restaurants, and I tallied up 65 Michelin stars last year. I would go to a place like Hong Kong and just hang out for 10-12 days and walk around, eating, whore mongering, and absorbing the life there. It was the greatest time of my life, but it also got boring after a while.

This is the point I'm getting at, I think people should try to get it out of their system when they're younger. All the traveling, the perverse sex, the fine dining, etc. Why do that when you're old and not able bodied anymore? When I returned to the states I felt completely fine returning to a normal life. I'm a pretty decent cook so I just cook for myself, and I've learned to judge women based on more than their looks.

People scoff at the whore mongering, but I think that taught me more about life than anything. Sex is just sex, plain and simple. In America we're deprived of it, and we spend so much energy pursuing women that aren't worth it. My weekend ritual for 5 years was going to bars trying to get laid, I basically didn't do anything other than that. Now I'm looking to date seriously, and I've really calmed down sexually. I made a few pornos, have gotten amazing blowjobs, and went on an ass fucking spree in Germany. It's all out of my system now, and it feels pretty good to be relieved of those desires that dominated my pursuits for so long (grew up with internet porn, which I'm sure did not help).

So yeah, things are pretty normal now and I'm fine with it. Will probably start looking for a job at a nice restaurant and continue where I left off and hope my investments continue to rise. I want a girl who will be a good mother and who is someone I find attractive and easy to get along with, that's all. >two-hundred thousand dollars in taxes
>taxes on Internet token trading 
>getting taxed on something the government doesn't even understand 

You got cucked you dumb fuck. You're also a massive autist. Only the retarded incels of you have to pay for sex and get it 'out of your system'. You're not made to be anything. Now you want to improve your mind and body, whatever the hell that fag shit means. Only thing you should have done is firstly not be a handicap by paying TWO HUNDRED GRAND to Uncle Sham, then get rippped, get yourself a decent house and all the essentials and attract women you want to fuck. Not pay them. 

You never made it, you had a brief vacation and now you're back at square 2. 

Why are all Americans so cringey and autistic? Something in their water?

Are you American? Because if you traded on Bittrex or used coinbase, the IRS can and will trace your activity which could lead to an investigation, which could lead to jail time (tax evasion is serious in the US, as it is almost anywhere) and/or a fine of the taxes you owe plus 30% of the taxes you owed.

Would be pretty shitty of me to have spent my 400k only to owe the IRS 300k down the line and also serve 3 years in prison.

I only cashed out via coinbase, and I just paid my taxes to avoid trouble. I work in the restaurant biz, so I understand all the under the table stuff and petty tax evasion that goes on, but if you're trying to cash out half a million dollars it's best to play it safe. >>9909201

>all you guys in your early 20s, you should travel the world, fuck hundreds of whores, and eat at the most expensive restaraunts!!
>oh? the money? Just use the 600k sitting in your bank account duh lol!! >Now go get some perspective while you’re still young! >>9909253
I sort of agree, but you definitely do not want herpes on your face. It's pretty much impossible to catch HIV from raw dogging a girl, you can get genital herpes though (which isn't the end of the world)

>>9909264
Mostly BTC, ETH, AE, NEO. I own a lot of Tron as well. I bought it for the memes around 2 cents, but I'm actually sort of happy I own so much of it now. It's like the ultimate shitcoin which balances out my other stable(ish) coins. >>9909262
>Are you American?

Literally just stated I'm a bong. Ok maybe you're new. I am British, our government doesn't care about shitcoin trading and cash-outs or stock trading even, nothing. 

>wow man putting my cock in 4/10 looking jungle gook pussy and paying a few grand at a time to insert my cock into a veteran dicksleeve riddled with shit and other men's cum really taught me a lot about the world man

What in the actual fuck. I just want to hear one story about 'making it' that doesn't involve suddenly rushing to the nearest escort website or disgusting greasy Thai 'women' or fucking taxes. >>9909201
Idc if you think you’ve made it or this is a larp. Girls in the states are fucking easy even the Stacey’s you’re just either 1, frail as fuck or 2, ugly as fuck. In which case no matter how much money you have you’ll never have really made it because your ugly ass genes are being erased from time by natural selection slowly but surely. >>9907418
Can the mods ban these fucking cuckposters already? That shit belongs on /pol/ >>9909253

>STDs are a meme 

Lol. You better hope you're really fucking lucky then. >>9909291
Sorry, I didn't know what a "bong" was, but I guess your government doesn't need taxes because why do you even need a government when you have Sharia law to govern you?

Regardless, you sure are edgy m8 please don't cut yourself. >>9909293
This, my best mate was in the US last year. American girls are fucking easy. I've spoken to so many and they have an order of magnitude more interest in me than girls in the UK. I got several girls asking me to stay with them when I finally go over and visit. The Eastern pilgrimage is that of the eternal incel. I'd rather fuck much hotter, white and Latina girls who are genuinely very attracted to me and speak my language and share some culture so we can just hang around and shit too. You don't get that with your 'pls puck me paster' dirty gook who wants your cash.

You people are utter fucking filth. >>9909330
Wonderful meme. Enjoy your memories which will soon be deeply repressed when you realise you blew a fortune and ruined your life's prospects of being an actual multi-millionaire because you wanted to put your weirdly shaped incel cock into dirty jungle people. How do you even find them attractive? Where's the pride? >>9909341

Stop it you’re killing him >>9909293
Why do you think that a person who sees escorts is a person who can't get laid? Don't knock it if you haven't tried it.

The only people who think whoring is "gross" or for weirdo losers are 1) women who feel threatened by the profession 2) jealous men who can't afford it >>9907418
how long did it take for you to run out of 200k? >>9909345
lol holy shit, don't tell me what will happen to me you bucktoothed retard. 100% you're a lanky british dork with more acne on his back than his face. Don't use words like "incel" you idiot, could you come off as more of an angry loser?

Here's a few facts. No girls like you, thinking that any woman would ever be "genuinely attracted to you" is laughable, and you're poor

>muh best friend was in america and he said girls there are ez hurrr durrr

kys m8 Anon wtf did you do, BAKA you blew your chance at never having to flip hamburgers again on loose p$$y, well I'm glad you enjoyed it now get back to work those burgers aren't going to do lip themselves >>9909396
*Flip >>9909382
About a year, I didn't cash it all out at once, usually in chunks of 20-50k. I also didn't do my traveling all together. I'd fly out to Europe for maybe two months, come back to the states for a while, go to Japan/HK for a month, etc

I stayed in pretty nice hotels too, betwen 170-400/night usually. >>9909385
>girls can't be attracted to men no you're wrong!!

And there we have it. Didn't take long for that to come out. You had the key to freedom and you blew it because you're obsessed with sex. You never fucked anyone you actually wanted to fuck, truly. That one girl, at the very least. 

Oh well, back to work. Those shelves aren't going to stack thems- oh wait, they will in around 3 years. The Philippines thanks you for increasing their GDP this year you undesirable reject. 

You never fucked anyone in your homeland who was attracted to you and this kills you on the inside. >>9907534
>>9909059


Absolutely based that you fucked around in Taipei, best city to have fun in imo >>9909412
Must've did so much partying you're exhausted lol.
As long as you use the rest of your funds to become financially free, i'd say good luck on your journey of becoming one with the universe. >>9909440
No, I said that no women would ever be genuinely attracted to specially YOU, can you not read?

Obviously not, since you missed the entire point of my other posts as well. Look m8, you're an ugly british retard, literally the grossest of all white people. I can tell by the way you write and the things you say. 

If it wasn't a lie, all the girls who "hurr plz stay with me when you come to america' think you're a non-threatening homosexual, and wouldn't fathom that someone as ugly as you would think they could them. Again, they would laugh at you.

You clearly hate women and do not understand them in the slightest. But that's fair, they hate you too. >>9907418
Not quite rich, but I cashed out close to six figures right after 2017 ended. I got my family lots of nice xmas presents, helped my dad get a newer car for work, and paid off my student loans. I wasn't expecting to make more than $50k from crypto so I ran with the opportunity as soon as I saw it. >>9909455
The food there is amazing. It's the one city where I didn't even do any fine dining (besides ding tai fung, but even that place isn't pretentious at all). I would just fast all day and wait until night to eat at the night markets, or get beef noodle soup at some famous shops. Taipei is one of the best cities, but the heat and humidity can be too much, even in the fall/early winter. Fucking escorts is basically the fact track to permanent omega male status, you could not be more of a fucking walkover having to pay money for a nasty cum dumpster, especially if its one of the south east Asian countries.

The one exception that can be made is if you have a threesome with a couple of top quality euro whores.

Unless your sex life is 95% unpaid, then you are beyond pathetic.

Also just imagine being retarded enough to take out all that money, pay taxes on it and blow it all on a turbo incel crusade rather than just reinvest it and have a chance at early retirement within 5 years. This is the most extreme case of someone bragging about being high status while being oblivious to how totally stupid and pathetic their decisions have been. If you are poor, read OP's post and recognise that his is a salutary tale.

Good cringe though, thanks OP. >>9909215
i'm glad i wasn't the only one to audibly kek at the 200k taxes

fellow bong here, whats your strategy to avoid HMRC? You fell for the pussy Jew, Pajeet. >>9909557

Better an omega male than gay! >>9907418

>blows it all

Is this fist nigger? This board is long dead mate. Ever since the december bullrun, the amount of s o y faggots here quadrupled in size Spending 50k on whores in a year, lmao, disgusting and pathetic. The thirst is real. >>9909557
Like I said, the only people against whore mongering are 1) women who feel threatened by the profession 2) jealous men who are poor

What I do with my earnings is my decision. I had the best year of my life, hands down. I had some insane sexual experiences in rapid succession (sometimes two whores in a day), wandered around amazing foreign cities by myself, ate the best crafted foods on Earth, and occasionally would meet cool girls and have a fling. It was perfect. >>9909253

How do I short HIV? >>9909501

Only a low IQ idiot and incels might be jealous. Disgusting for everybody else. >>9909717
lol, well I first hit it huge in May. With RDD and DGB I turned 35k into 450k, and it was a somewhat rocky trajectory upwards until the peak in Jan.

My first global trek was in July and August. I've never seen a prostitute before and was super nervous, but I just did some research online and started in Berlin. I would have at least one girl come to my room each day (somedays I would take breaks), usually in the afternoon, then I would go out at night and walk around exploring the city. It was amazing. No pressure, no one to answer to, no responsibility, no itinerary, just doing whatever I wanted. My best combo trip was Taipei/Kyoto/Tokyo. I really love asia and the food was incredible. The whoring was probably better in Germany/Prague but the eating in Asia blew me away. I would just ride the subway around Tokyo, get off, walk around and look at things. It was beautiful, I felt like I was in a movie.

My friends definitely started noticing shit on my instagram. A lot of them thought I was going through some culinary training program because I was eating at the best restaurants in the world. >>9909717
One of my best friends growing up was in shock when I told him about what I had made (and I even lied, lowering the true amount I made). I had told him to invest in crypto when I first started, but he kind of brushed me off and never did, probably thinking it was some crazy scheme I had stumbled into. He almost couldn't get words out when he finally dug out of me how much I had made, it was the first time I've ever seen him stunned. He's a smart guy and he went to law school then got his MBA, but he has over 500k in debt and the career path he picked actually isn't that lucrative for a lawyer, so I think he just realized he missed on the chance to wipe all his debt away. We're both the same age, but his hair is going VERY grey, and I haven't found a grey yet. It must have been weird because I went to college for engineering, but just decided to work in restaurants after college with no real plan, while he was always super anal about his education and eventual career trajectory. It must have made him feel weird, because we're best friends, but I was always the "do whatever I want guy and enjoy my life" and I'm sure he was expecting me to get my comeuppance soon, but instead I made a million dollars with shit coins (this was during that time).

I never really let it get to my head though, I am still the same person, I can just do whatever I want within reason now. I do think that experience while you're relatively young is much more important, because the rest of your life is built on your current aggregated experience, and I think life is more like a rolling snowball than a ladder.

I don't know if I'll stay in the restaurant business, I enjoy it but it's hard on your body. I just feel happy having experienced the past year in the way I did, and I'm thankful to crypto and biz as well for helping me amass funds from nothing. I hope we all continue making it. >>9909781
Why is it disgusting? Most people don't have sex for love, just look at tinder culture. I just get to skip all the bullshit and save myself the time of chasing women that I don't have any feelings for.

My entire argument early on was that whore mongering frees up your emotions to actually find a woman you love and can settle down with, instead of being caught in the never ending hamster wheel of weekend thot chasing. You sound like one of those people that win the lottery and then frivolously spend all their money >>9909848
well, I do plan on being more financially responsible moving forwards, and also those lottery winners spend their money on material things usually. I spent all my money on experiences, and I think it was a wonderful decision. >>9907418
i want to do this but im scared of the sexually transmitted diseases.

i am almost /madeit/ status too

i would fuck a trap or 2 on my asia tour as well and keep it to myself >>9909862
The idea actually crossed my mind a couple of times of getting sucked off by a trap, because I figured they look like actual women (in thailand and the philipines at least), and they're probably crazy good at blowjobs since they literally have dicks and know what feels good, unlike a lot of women.

But no dude, that's still gay in my book. I don't really want to go through life knowing that I got sucked off by a dude one time... >>9909832
Not gonna explain you why you are a peasant and have peasant like behaviour. The fact that you were hanging out in bars every weekend for several years hitting on average thots, says everything about yourself. Doesn't help that you were or are a simple dumb kitchen helper. >>9909924
Buddy, I come from one of the wealthiest communities in Connecticut, went to private school my entire life, and attended a top American university. I might only be a line cook right now, but the restaurant I work in is pretty nice and I'm happy. Which one of us is the peasant again? >>9907450
How did you find them? some specific agency? >>9907546
jnt >>9909977
you
you made one million and now you desperately seek for approval on an anonymous forum
you rage out at guys telling them they don't know women while you need to pay women to tolerate you
you gloat over someone you call your best friend working hard and having grey hairs
if you could step back and see yourself through the eyes of an outsider (who isn't 18 years old and envious), you'd see someone caught up in a whirlwind, way over their head, and rapidly losing ground
i wouldn't be surprised if you killed yourself in less than 5 years, i mean it's thankfully a low chance, but you definitely have the personality for it. so here's some advice, after you're done with your "celebratory" 4chan thread, do find some work you enjoy to keep your life full and fulfilled >>9909977
You could of owned that restaurant, now your just another anon working in it, you blew your chance enjoy your life and retiring at 65 >>9909627
That's how we know it's not a LARP.

Only a complete cock-brained idiot would not invest that kind of cash into self-sustaining activities guaranteeing a passive income. It's not like it's difficult to buy real estate then get an agency to rent that shit. Unbelievable jelly in this thread. OP had a lot of fun.
Cucks hating for it are likely jealous of his remaining 600k.
LMAO >>9909977
>brags about having rich parents >>9910084
again, why does everyone think that whore mongering is about "not being able to get girls" or "paying girls to 'tolerate' you".

It's simply about getting a really good nut on demand without putting in the social effort. Try not to read into it too much beyond that.The point of my post was not only about whores, but about traveling and living and gaining special experiences. 

You're projecting. I've literally stated that I'm extremely happy with my uncommon experiences over the last year and am peace with working as a line cook, yet you say I'm caught in a whirlwind and will kill myself within 5 years? And that I should find some work that I enjoy to keep my life fulfilled? I left a top university with an engineering degree and now I'm a line cook... am I literally doing exactly that.

Can no one here read? >>9910119
buddy, let me teach you something about investing, taxes, and real estate.

Let's say I was not a cock brained idiot and cashed out my remaining crypto at 1MM. At the time having cashed out around 380k total already, and 150k in that tax year, I would have owed the IRS 560k from crypto alone.

That leaves me with 560k to invest with, post tax.

That's a studio in Manhattan. That's 3k at most a month in rent, and after taxes and HOA that's 1.8k a month.

So, I could have spent a year living it up and doing everything I ever wanted to do, while still having 600k in crypto while I head towards long term cap gains with a tax rate of 20% instead of 50%

OR I could own a tiny studio in a major US city and collect 1.8k a month for the rest of my life on a pretty consistent basis.

I'm not saying one is definitely better than the other, I'm just saying that the whole "holy shit you wasted ur 1 chance at financial freedum!!!111!!" thing is a bit of an exaggeration. Also, to everyone mocking me for reporting my taxes. Fair criticism.... I guess.

But if crypto booms again, I'm looking at 1-2MM dollars at least, with long term capital gains tax rates.

How do I prove this? By my previous years tax returns. I'm fine with paying 20%, I think that's fair for making an exorbitant amount of money with relatively little effort. If you try to launder 1-2MM you will get fucked by the IRS, and if you just say it magically appeared you won't get long term cap gains at best, and you'll be facing criminal tax evasion at worst.

Just some insight for you crypto traders, plan ahead. Lmao you made it by fucking hookers?
Jeez isn't there anyone on this board with a gf or the balls to pull a normal girl
Fucking robots >>9910457
yes, I made it by fucking hookers. Post moar whore stories as encouragement. This is a thread about having your cake and eating it too. Money enables you with more choice who cares about the choices made by others when they don't fit your worldview. >>9910529
The best blowjob I got was actually from an Indonesian girl in Montreal. I couldn't really tell from the pictures what kind of Asian she was, but I was in the mood for that. I was sort of surprised because she was really dark, petite, and super ripped. I was looking for an east asian but whatever, I wasn't going to send her away because I'm not an asshole. I told her I didn't want to have sex and just to blow me.

I was expecting a mediocre bj but holy fucking shit, she actually ripped my dick up with her mouth, no teeth ever, and made me cum in 8 minutes with no hand stroking, just her mouth. It was just hard, constant sucking with her lips and tongue rolling around my dick. I've never felt anything like it before, it was incredible.

This other girl in Berlin was giving me a blowjob and it ended with something that's never happened to me before. She was pretty good at head but not amazing or anything, but when I was about to come, she jammed her mouth to the base of my dick and made me cum in her throat.

It didn't necessarily feel better than a constant, hard suck when nutting, but the psychology of it was really different and arousing. I've never nutted down a girl's throat before. She just held me there, it was nice. >>9909819

how old are u? how did u end up as a chef?

i am an engineer to but would much rather work in hotels and restaurants. did this when i was young and quite enjoyed it. >>9907418
Names of the $2k pornstars >>9910672
I'm 27. I'm not a chef, just a line cook ATM, which means I do mostly prep work, chores, and will sometimes fry stuff or fill in other positions when we get busy.

I worked in a restaurant as a teenager and thought it was fun (was a bus boy, but learned a lot about the kitchen). I saw a help wanted sign, inquired, then started as a fry cook.

You will need to have some basic culinary knowledge if you want to work in a kitchen, but unless you're working at a mid-upscale restaurant you don't need formal training. >>9907418

>Sudden success ruined me. >>9910734
Sudden success didn't ruin you.
You got ruined by 2 things:
1. tax evasion
2. being a cuck

When you make it, you cannot associate with plebians anymore.

I made it similar to you but I'm an antisocial snob so I only talk to other wealthy people. >>9910734

I'm probably an 8/10. My mother was in a Miss America contestant when she was young.

As for the girls, depends on the region and price. Girls in the 600+ range are usually a 7 or above. With 200+ range they're between 4-7. I didn't get any really ugly girls. Taipei had way hotter hookers than HK or Tokyo. Prague had the hottest overall, Berlin a close second. Montreal girls are kind of dumpy IMO, only had one really hot one there. >>9910744

Yeah i didn't know that. I thought people cared for me for me. Wasn't the case. Helped the wrong people (Also helped others pay their debts etc) 

>>9910745

No worries. I find life has a feedback loop. I'll make it again. But this time i'm going to play it smart. >>9910757
so let me get this straight; all the women you fucked you paid for?

Tinder is easier in Asia, but asian girls are not as easy to fuck as western girls. Most asian girls, at least the pretty ones, are conservative which makes it harder. European girls were much easier in my opinion. But like I said, I didn't sleep with very many non-hookers. The non-hookers I hung out with or had sex with were genuinely cool girls that I liked. >>9907418

Trump is obviously on a mission to create a larger wealth divide in the US. Everything he is doing is driving the dollar down and putting proportionally more of them in the ultra wealthy’s hands. Poor stupid Trump supporters say things like “I’m getting more money I don’t care if rich people get more too”, but don’t consider that their dollars are going to be worth less and their standard of living will actually be going down despite having more dollars. While this is happening, rich people are accumulating WAY more dollars and will indefinitely be able to live wealth and keep poor people stifled and controlled. Even if dollar value were to rise again, Trump is ensuring cost of goods is also rising so that only rich people will be able to afford any luxuries at all, or in many cases things the currently consider normal amenities and services such as being able to replace a window in their home when it breaks.
The stupidity of the American poor is their downfall. The rich have done a good job of ensuring control by creating a country where private education comes at too high of a price and public education is awful, and so poor people continue to be stupid and don’t understand their own plight or how to fix it. Cue some fucking brain dead celebrity putting $1,000 in their pocket and that’s all they’re even considering. Meanwhile that same celebrity is laughing at them because he used to be a failed businessman and has finally found a way to manipulate poor people to enhance his own wealth. On top of that, he is a classic narcissist and egomaniac, the exact kind of personality who does not care about others and will walk all over them to meet his own needs. And yet poor people still only see the $1,000. >>9900536
So wtf do you suggest? Continue letting china milk us like the last 5 presidents did? Until nobody has a fuckig job anymore?

China might still fuck us but at least trump is trying to give us a chance by ramping up our manufacturing that has been decimated by the deep state >>9900536
You sincerely doubt how huge America is compared to its population. America only trades with other countries to be friendly at this point. They need our money, not the other way around >>9900579

The question still stands. Wtf do you suggest trump does? Stick with the same gameplan the last few presidents have done by destroying our manufacturing??

Deep stare or not.... our manufacturing has been GUTTED. And we have fiat currency that becomes more worthless which prompts these countries to impose tariffs on us.

So wtf do you sugges trrump do? >>9900588
>America only trades with other countries to be friendly at this point.
The delusion

The US trades with other countries because its manufacturing is fucking shit. Look at americars, they are fucking garbage compared to everyone else. >>9900613
Half its defence budget is a start. >>9900597
What many brainlets do not understand is that purchasing power comes from production.

If you don't produce you die.

You think china is going to be trading in dollars for the next 50 years?

They already have yuan oil futures contracts backed by gold >>9900579
You do realize manufacturing jobs both here and in China are disappearing thanks to advanced robotics, right? The country that gets rid of them completely first and can reduce cost of goods and export cheaper is the one that wins. You somehow think increasing manufacturing jobs, which is incredibly costly, will result in businesses succeeding, while all of their global competitors are paying way less to manufacture thanks to robotics? The US market alone is not enough to support the jobs we need, and even if it was we would have to charge so much for goods due to the high cost to make them that none of those people working the manufacturing jobs would be able to afford what they’re actually making.

Open your eyes. Reverting to a 1950’s era economy when the rest of the world is moving towards a 2020 economy is going to kill the US. It will legitimately enter third world territory, where the poor do all of the labor and get none of the fruits of that labor, and the ultra wealthy sit in their high horses and have no reason to change anything. And the middle class slowly dissipates. Trade is a two way street friends. More tariffs on Chinese goods entering the USA only means Americans must pay more for those goods. 

Americans are not a charity, they bought from China because they had value.

Either the extra costs are absorbed by Americans, or they find someone else to supply them with the goods at the same price. >>9900633
So why aren't we producing more? >>9900613
Maybe encourage research into robotics and AI as applied to manufacture of goods? That would actually require understanding implications of applied arising technology.
Pretty difficult for an old fat piece of shit with dementia. >>9900597
Making your own goods is more expensive if the minimum wage is 7$ an hour rather than buying them from people working for 7$ a month. >>9900628
I agree but unironically our military gives us the leverage and time to ramp our manufacturing back up before china let's the dollar go >>9900653
The US has no WW2 era war to use the industrial-military complex to its advantage to stop a great depression. >>9900650
Trump didn't take us off the gold standard either. That 7$/hour used to be great income in the 50's. Not anymore tho >>9900597
Yes because people in the US do not work for pennies retard. You will see a huge price increase if you need to buy all your goods from people in your country. AKA protectionism Wow, its fucking nothing

What first world country has a big manufacturing industry? There is no way you can be competitive with slave labor your only options are to outsource or automate. Right now we outsource but soon automation and AI will take over that whole industry and then China is fucked. >>9900846
What's wrong with slaves? Slaves have been the norm before human history. Those black slaves were already slaves in Africa so why not use them here where a white man actually has the brains to plan a prosperous society?

Every great civilization was built on the backs of slaves.

You fucking cuck faggots probably actually think slaverybwas invented and patented in America. 

There are millions of slaves in Africa today in the year 2018. More than any southern plantation owner could have ever dreamt ITT: kids who buy crypto and don't understand economics discuss why you shouldn't trust Celestials.

nice digits but you have a simplistic view of the world as most brainlets do. that debt will never be collected. the yuan is pegged to the dollar if America goes down China goes down the chinks aren't going to commit economic suicide. >>9901049
China won't go down. China has been accumulating record tonnage of gold for a reason. Chinese citizens collectively own 6k tons of gold in their hands. 

What? You think China's long term gameplan is to rely on the dollar forever? >>9900782
Most of what China produces is American products where raw materials are shipped there for manufacturing and then finished product is shipped back. That will start declining sharply as automation gets better and more affordable. >>9901091
Pretty nice delusion, I bet you never, ever saw an industrial robot in your life tho. >>9900994
Trade =/= manufacturing >>9900781
>dude robotics are going to replace everything, haven't you seen that 2012 youtube video proving humans will be obsolete in 5 years >>9901076
Not forever but the main reason they are able to remain so competitive is because they keep devaluing their currency. If yuan isn't pegged to the dollar they can no longer do that and their exports will suffer massively. >>9900613
are you literally retarded? "BUT THEY TOOK OUR JOBS" why don't you go read a book and actually learn how the economy works before spouting off nonsense. Manufacturing jobs are not coming back, it is too costly to manufacture goods in a first world country. Not to mention our economy relies on the outsourced low cost labor for inputs into pretty much every industry. Low cost labor is the fuel in our economy but you trumptards could never wrap your head around that >>9901108
I used to work in industrial automation. If you think AI and automation isn't going to take over manufacturing I don't know what to tell you. The evidence is all around you. >>9901184
I currently work in manufacturing r&d. What did you do ? >>9900597
Holy fuck you're a brainlet.
yes, because the PPP of China is substantially lower than the U.S.
Also it's hard to build 'differentiation' into labor intensive jobs like manufacturing (it's called the 'Smile Curve' although it looks more like a Smirk). Coupled that with the lower cost of materials in China, and a competitive environment that means that investors into Chinese manufacturers will accept lower profit margins than U.S. investors products in China can be produced and shipped to the United States far cheaper than they can in the United States.
Because - 1. labor costs are higher in the United States, 2. raw materials are more expensive 3. if you say to investors looking for capital 'hey I'm going to go into direct competition with Chinese manufacturers in this low-margin business' they will laugh you out of the room: you can't start up a company doing that.
This is why there's such a push to automation, because if done right you can almost totally cut out the labor costs

Fiat currency not backed by gold enabled that need for low cost labor while they gut American manufacturers. If you can't see it was all by design to fuck regular Americans I don't know what to tell you. 

It's you that doesn't understand the economy and that you need REAL money backing the currency otherwise your forced to outsource cheap labor.

Our govt priced its own citizens out of the market. You think manufacturing just magically left here without any sort of engineering going on? >>9900426

They can only retaliate so much. They sell 450B, America sells 100B. When the imbalance is that big there's only so much you can do. >>9901345
You are actually misunderstanding the situation. If American companies cannot find a suitable replacement this will increase prices which directly affect the amount consumers can spend. Also include the cost of American exports that rely on Chinese parts. Trade is a two way street meaning both sides will lose and gain in some respects, but the overall efficiency of the market will be reduced. >>9901406
He’s really good at master level stuff, when you start to understand persuasion it’s incredibly obvious the low level tier persuasion he uses on the audience. He does it on purpose though because he has new viewers everyday. The low level stuff works on normies and you have to use it to keep them coming back. Also if you want a masterclass in persuasion listen to his debate with Sam Harris. He reduced Harris into a stuttering mess, he was literally inside sams brain rewiring it. >>9901361
The US is the first world country in the world with most of its GDP (70%) oriented towards consumption. Countries like China and Singapore have this number below 40%. An economy cannot be oriented towards consumption for long periods of time because you go too much into debt, which is what has happened in the US. At some point you have to move out of this or everyone is fucked in the long run. The turn is now happening for the US and you guys will have to deal with higher prices for a while. Although one of the ideas is that these tariffs will make the price of dollar higher and the yuan lower, which will hopefully offset part of the tariffs, but I can't know if this will happen for sure. >>9901435
Tariffs are self-mutilating. It’s not just ‘trade imbalances are bad’. Americans bought Chinese goods because they had value. Tariffs will kill Chinese jobs but at the cost of making American consumers pay more for their goods and any refined goods that require Chinese parts will cost more on the international market, making American exports less competitive. We need to ban intellectual property. >>9901396
I think you have slavery and oppressed mixed up breh. Not slaves because they aren’t doing shiiit. Oppressed yes, because they can’t do shiiiiit. >>9901498
Tariffs should be up by 75% to actually kill chinese jobs. It will simply raise prices for US businesses and consumers. It's a badly throught-out VAT, if you prefer. >>9901498
They are self-mutilating but like I said, if China retaliates, the US retaliates, and this goes on until there's nothing China can do anymore. Both parties will lose but China will always lose more. >>9901522

that's for sure. He's so painfully obvious at re-framing. And the whole 'Dale' bit, which while funny, I just feel like 'don't fucking patronize me by literally reducing the opposition to a weak tissue-paper cartoon character'. And on that note what I did learn form Adams 100% is he opened my eyes to what I would call 'visual rhetoric' - how Trump actually is very good at using language to put across visual ideas, but also visually encapsulating the qualities he wants to communicate
National Security? A wall. Even if it was a metaphor it's a fucking visual metaphor. A fucking wall.
When he imitates Hilary (and many others, but especially her), watch his body language he shakes about like she's indecisive or as Scott likes to keep emphasizing "crooked"
Who were his first two picks for Secretary of State: Mitt Romney and Rex Tillerson? Why? Silverhaired No-Nonsense guys.
I could go on and on, but that's one thing that once I started digging around I realized was a whole realm of communication that is really underutilized. I mean I usually only considered it with print-advertising. >>9901544
China has already announced they will retaliate with the same amount of tariffs on the same amount of goods, we'll see how far it goes.
>average tariffs on chinese goods in the US : +3%
>average tarrifs on US goods in china : +12%
Guess who is gonna suppress who ? You're an idiot if you think this has anything to do with trade imbalances. It's been clear from the beginning that what Trump wants to see is a total disruption of the way the Chinese do business.

This is why there's not more outright rebellion in the business community about what he's doing. They're all well aware of how badly they've been screwed by China and they're just as tired of it as he is.

And for those Republicans that keep complaining to him...well, they're gonna get destroyed in elections, so who gives a fuck what they think? >>9901605
It’s an entirely different world. I remember coming across persuasion and thinking it was a crock of shit. Now I think Scott’s right when he talks about tapping into a reality that humans can’t completely grasp. You can place images and situations in people’s minds with words. Their brain HAS to process that information, the brain does it automatically and the listener/viewer has no choice. Trump used persuasion to become the most powerful man on the planet, is persuasion the most powerful tool mankind can have I wonder? >>9900650
If people don't have money and jobs to buy goods from these cheap workers, then all that production is pointless. Supply and demand nigger. Jesus, people in /biz/ are one of the most illiterate pieces of mouth-breathing retards in the history of the earth. >>9901544
China doesn’t have to tariff American imports as retaliation. American import tariffs are self-mutiliating retaliatory acts themselves. If image is all you concern yourself with so be it. There is no ‘they’ll hurt more then we will’ scenario, it’s both sides punching each other and themselves equally. >>9900426

Chang, the point of the tariffs is to make sure US manufacturing companies go back making products on the US itself and if they take their factories outside, then they suffer a penalty. Not sure what you're babbling about. It's a hard concept, I know. >>9901675
Except it isn't, people, laypeople, do this all the time. People pick up persuasion from a young age and do it just through passive observation and behaving in ways and getting rewards as a part of basic language acquisition and 'acculturation'. 
What Scott's doing, and he's by his own admission not the first but he sure acts like he is (ahhh ~*persuasion*~!), is he's actually pointing out and giving names to those phenomena with a bit more accuracy then those terrrrrrrrrible 'secrets to body language' success books.

Here's how this works.

China stops selling stuff to the US. The US says, ok, we'll buy it from someone else because we're fucking rich.

The US stops buying stuff from China. China says, ok, we'll start selling to....uh............EU? No, they don't want it. Africa? Er, they got no money? Russia??? No????? Fuck.

The Chinese, of course, have a major political advantage over Trump in that China is a dictatorship and the US is a democracy. Trump is banking on the fact that China will over-reach and try to interfere in US elections, which will give him more than enough ammunition to completely destroy China on the international stage. >Trump idiotically ends the Korean conflict

Most of the fashion they're into is European owned, and made in China. 
I knew a girl who worked in a LV factory. It was bizarre, they didn't really care if she took stuff off the line sometimes, so she had an apartment full of LV stuff. If she ever needed to give a gift to anyone, just drop an LV bag on them. Normally it'd be 300 bucks, but for her it was valueless. She would've sold them, but it didn't seem right to her. I guess she was worried she'd lose her job. >>9901786

China is selling flip flops in exchange for mining rights
Most of australias mineral exports go to china
The us can and will not win the economic competition with china, especially in a free trade world. Why? China is playing the long game extremely well and the us is financing an overstretched military instead of investing in its economy. Trump is trying to pick up the pieces but its too late. China will rule the next century, unless china decentralizes into local elites - which i see as likely. Still, the fact that they effectively control the mines of this world won't change. >>9902074
Critical theory doesn't magically fix the blockers of the human mind. >>9901983
China doesnt like trading with NK. Japan and SK still concerned about NK and China (bigger picture) so will not welcome US disarmament. Also southeast asia would prefer if the US stays to help shun the chinese island expansion some truly dumb fuckers on this thread >>9902153
>Japan and SK still concerned about NK and China (bigger picture)
As much as Japan is concerned about NK and China, you will find that in Korea, they much prefer China and NK to Japan any day of the week.
The Yanks barged in there and fucked up SK pretty hard until they bucked American development plans in the 60's and 70's and saved themselves more violence and poverty. The Americans do not think about the fact that Korea has always been oriented towards China and against Japan, and that SK was the "occupied" Korea, not NK. SK was seen as a continuation of colonial rule, whereas NK was lead by a patriot who fought the Japanese. South Koreans are not stupid about their security, but they're also no-longer in a dictatorship and are becoming more cognizant of what really happened in the war. 

Unified Korea will not be oriented towards the Americans, because that means being against China and with Japan. That might sound believable to Americans, but for most Koreans, that's not realistic. I'm not saying they'll be Communist by any means, but they will have shifted who their big friends are. America will also lose any access to the Yellow Sea, be distant from a strike on Beijing, and no-longer have any relevant military force on the East Asian continent. 

America NEEDS North Korea. They give them an excuse to keep dominance over the peninsula, and weapons near Beijing. >>9902149

First you have to be aware of the specific psychological universe that humans can only sometimes glimpse. From there you can maneuver around said perception with more proficiency. I'm sure with enough practice you could literally control almost any outcome ie: Trump being the most powerful man on the planet. Adams is already ahead because he's known about this alternate psychological reality for decades. >>9901522

>>9902596
I'm not apologetic for Russia, or a fan of China, but the USA has it's head up it's ass in regards to how much aggression and shortsighted fuckery they caused during and after the Cold War.
The Communists understood independence movements like the Viet Minh or Kim Il Sung's visions for Korea. They understood that people were sick of colonial oppression. And they took advantage of it effectively. America championed itself as the good guy, and promptly wandered around to shit on all those movements for self-determination and independence. They created their own monsters by not being able to see the world from anyone else's point of view, and judging from Afghanistan, Iraq, and now Trump, they still haven't improved. It's disgusting, hypocritical and self-sabotaging. 

Plus, left wing American intellectuals blame most of this shit on European colonialism and Empire, totally downplaying what America did to the developing world. 

If Trump wants to isolate his country, and turn their backs on everyone else, I say let him. They don't act like anyone else matters, so we shouldn't act like they matter. In my country, many people say "I don't like America, but I like Americans,". Recently that has even been changing. Now people just don't like anything to do with the place. It's obvious that many of them have a critical failure when it comes to trying to see the world from anyone else's point of view, whether that be enemies or allies. BFF forever Trump is such a fucking idiot. What's missing from that list is tariffs on finished products. When my companies component costs go up 25% how are we going to be able to compete against Chinese Manufacturers who can sell FINISHED GOODS without tariffs. The fuck he is thinking. This is going to destroy what's left of manufacturing the in US. >>9902664

The U.S. doesn't need to. More than any other country on the planet, the U.S. could, if it wanted, make all the things it needs for itself due to its vast natural resources and human resources.

That said, even if China refused to trade with the U.S., Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and some European countries could step right in. In fact, Japan would be absolutely ecstatic if China no longer did business with the U.S. They would retake the market share of the electronics industry they used to dominate. >>9902891

When we are talking about these kind of debt it's the creditors who are in trouble, not the entity owing money, the USA aren't really Greece.

China can't damage the US without seriously damaging itself in the process too, despite the rise of a new chinese middle class the economy has been shaped during the last 30 years to export, they don't have the domestic market to absorb what they produce.

People underestimate how much in a strong position the USA still are these days because they did not really flex economically since the end of the Cold War but it's still a self-sufficient "island" with a bigger GDP than the EU and tremendous military presence.

However on the long term it's a very risky business because if europeans and asians decide to really build an Eurasian economic highway America will lose its hegemony fast.
Right now only the chinks really wish that as the europeans are still fervently atlanticist but if they do a 180* and decide to be more friendly and active toward Russia/China/Iran the americans will rapidly be isolated in 2 decades.

That said Trump is right, chinks have expanded unchecked in every domain while cheating their way out without repercussions.
Worse the fact that westerners have been sucking their cocks to get some crumbs of China growth, in the meantime Obama was a wimpy nigger and neocons too obsessed with protecting Israël and meddling in the Middle East to have a strategy.
They must learn that they are not the biggest bullies yet and that the West still dominate them. 50cents and shareblue are out in force. Remember /biz/ is a pro Trump board. >>9903809

Nice argument there, Agent Smith. 

China's economy is wholly dependent on US consumerism and nonexistent trade barriers. If China starts selling off USD en masse, the short-term effect would be bad for both countries, but ultimately the Yuan would get obliterated to the point where the Chinks would no longer be able to adequately fund their own National Defense. 

The US dollar would still be the world reserve currency and a much more desirable alternative to the Euro (especially given the uncertainty/domestic turmoil they're currently facing), and would be further strengthened by the return of US manufacturing. Based Trump. 25% tarriff on 3rd world imports is perfectly reasonable and should have always been in place >>9906230

From where is this statement? They already have Central Bank of Jordan. These guys do not use terms like "very major" lightly. They're in the finance world. They didn't even bother hyping up the Jordan partnership at all. They don't really brag about SEED either. Plus you have that Tapscott tweet from a few months ago in that he had visited Bank of England. And Tapscott's latest book launch in NYC last week was sponsored by Jibrel Network. >>9909055

- CPU mining (GPU resistant, ASIC resistant)
- Typo proof wallet (can't send to wrong address)
- Smart miners (pools can't initiate 51% attacks as miners verify transactions on their own)
- Schnorr signatures
- Hashed Timelock contracts (Lightning ready)
- NiPoPoW (potential use for sidechains)
- 1 minute block times
- Installation free
- Browser mining 8MN$ Marketcap.

anyone.. yes ANYONE can disable all transfers for the 800M USD$ marketcap ICON.

Go ahead... try it yourself... send 0 eth and 0xe2a9ca4c in the data field to the ICX contract

Or look at the transaction history, look at the failures from it being turned off.... LULZ wtf Nice fud. Loser go look for yourself -- I won't send links so you trust the info


Find the ICX contract... see how transfers in the past hour have failed? Because someone disabled them

Now you try........ >>9906129
Been around since 2016. Doesn't matter senpai lol it's true I think. Look at https://etherscan.io/address/0xb5a5f22694352c15b00323844ad545abb2b11028

The last tx that succeeded disables token transfers. They fucked up the wallet check

 modifier onlyFromWallet {
 require(msg.sender != walletAddress);
 _;
 }

The "good" news is that anyone can re-enable the token transfer by calling enableTokenTransfer but then anyone can disable it again

thanks just sold 300 Yup. Same bug that fucked Yggdrash today because the same code monkey did both contracts. >>9906078
Holy fuck just checked it on test net can confirm Fuck me this is bad... Can I even dump the tokens if i can't send them to exchange... weak fud >>9906203

nope, you got perma gooked >>9906203
it's been reactivated now but it's a crapshoot if it gets disabled while the exchange needs to move your funds to its central wallet. Safest bet would probably be to use a decentralized exchange since if the tx fails you can just try again Token swap at June 20th, just hold on a little longer. >>9906217
> require(msg.sender != walletAddress);

Are code reviews not a thing in Korea? or unit tests? probably outsourced to street shitters So this is the power of Ethereum of Korea >>9906217

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Why? WHy did someone have to do this? I was gooked for 6 fucking months. Token swap comes, and now this.

Why....... Someone has to create a bot that keeps spamming the disable command every few minutes or so. Holy shit, it's real.

WTF Push me to the edge, all my gains are dead.

top kek So people who have their tokens in a wallet can't dump. Got my icx on binance, should I dump eet? Guess the token swap will be a bit delayed.
Lmao > mfw i spend $1 dollar to troll ICX bagholders

i picture them in my mind raging when their txs fail Shall I make a bot to enable transfers every time someone disables them? hew new are you fags?
this is intentional to make you sell before the moon

it was found today because the same idiot made the contract for Yggdrash >>9906078
i warned em that the chart was ugly signaling that it's a weak project

Feel bad for ICX holders but this is the only good thread on biz all day I held this fucking coin since December. I owe a shitload of taxes. I fucking trusted this gooks. 
Half a year of delays. Half a year of broken promises.

Holy fuck. I don't even know what to feel right now. Hatred? Sadness? Won’t his be a non issue on the 20th once on mainnet?! >>9906844
Somebody must have caught it before today, ICON's ERC20 has been live for 276 days >>9906875
you can't move your tokens >>9906866
Worst thing is that they won't get nuked by North Korea. Was hoping for some revenge from that side but nope. Of course it will be an issue. What if your tokens are on MEW. how will they be transfered? >>9906875
Right it's only a bug on ERC-20 but the issue is there already is little confidence left in them due to the delays, now if this spreads everyone in the community will put them in the joke category like TRX and WTC.

So if they can't even write a contract, how can they actually have a main net. Then it explains all the delays etc. No confidence = no token holders = no one to buy my bags = FUCKING GOOKED. I FUCKING HATE YOU GOOKS. FUCK YOU MIN YOU FUCKING FAGGOT PIECE OF SHIT >>9906893 >>9906890
Just spam txs and hope somebody called `enableTokenTransfer` A bot will have to be implemented to spam enable tx....might congest network down but this isn’t a FATAL FLAW. I tethered 25% of stack just in case I can get some on the cheap tho transactions are coming through again

how are you going to do a token swap if the smart contract is fucked, it's not like you can change it. should I dump? > should I dump?

only makes sense and buy back cheaper once the news spreads My coins have been on Binance since the beginning
Someone help a brainlet. Should I just dump them? Or hold and wait for recovery >>9906992
that reddit post said Binance disabled deposits/withdrawals. Save us CZ >>9906996
I don't know bro. I was considering dumping it all because I've already lost all confidence in these scamming gooks and now this. No wonder it took 6 months.

Binance apparently disabled deposits & withdrawals. Which explains why the price has been relatively steady. I'm very close to dumping it all. Only to be expected from a project that kept delaying, same shit from wtc and everything else. 
Amateur gooks who just rode the ico wave getting exposed left and right >>9906774
It will block all icx transactions anyone else dumping their ICX? >>9907099
I had 10k on Binance, dumped it a minute ago. Not sure if or when to buy back in. >>9907099
Dumped 20k, not sure if it was the right call or not, since the token swap is in a few days anyway Fuck this stupid was market
It is such a mind fuck and con
The stress is not worth it, and plus everyone is down on their incestment.

>1.40
Sounds about right. It wouldn't be such a blunder if there hadn't been constant delays to the project already with barely any updates. They lost their main developer months ago and they don't seem to have covered/check the codebase properly since. They obviously don't have a clue whats going on and there's probably going to be further delays now. Genuinely unacceptable with a near billion dollar platform. Glad >>9907253

Exiting at 35k sats was best thing I did fuck. When did they lose their main coder? Who was it? unaware tradering buying icon thinks its jsut a dip are gonna get rekt when it doesnt stop dipping.. gonna lose 90% of its marketcap in the next hour HAHAHAHAHAHA I'M BUYING SO MUCH
YOU GUYS ARE SO STUPID glad i kept it all binace cuz my dumbass brain didnt know what to do when the token swap happened now I'm gonna tether up and wait

This is a redpill many here on biz don't seem to have grasped yet. Western developers/teams like EOS or Ethereum are the future of crypto/ the safest bet to make. There's a reason even the koreans/chinese themselves are more interested in western platforms. Even they're aware their is a clear superiority of skilled developers in America. Blockchain is cutting edge technology and its going to be in the U.S where it happens as it already has been. ICX probably has a future, but theirs levels to this game and the next microsofts/apples of blockchain reside in america. Telegram panic Holy shit. All the useless pajeet tokens /biz/ shilled are unironically slowly going to zero. >>9907382
For that reason I am accumulating Linkies. suprised this didnt get spotted sooner
can't really profit from it.

It is just a coding typo, doesn't affect ICON when it goes on mainnet

What does so is lower confidence and as you can see the price dumps tonights entertaiment: watching shitcoin icon finally die >>9907408
A platform with a billion mcap should have a coding type. Gookfucks DELISTING WHEN?? https://twitter.com/minhokim/status/1007800274252062720

fixed? This gook reacts the moment he sees the dump to pump it up again. EVERYONE RELAX AND BUY BACK ASAP

We're back baby thanks for the cheap gookCX boys this was a well coordinated combo of P&D and minor bug. Good job Discord. >>9907445
> permanent solution

bullshit, they will have to migrate contract for that which is a huge hassle >>9907301
ETC will be the "cheapest" coin on Coinbase.
I predict it will overtake LTC and reach a similar ratio to ETH as BCH is to BTC.

BAT is the token with the best chance of being first. DCG invested in Brave and Coinbase.

Don't be surprised if they don't add anything this year though. It took them over 4 months to add Bitcoin Cash and they seem to time their announcements to try to keep bitcoin from crashing too much. >>9907490
BAT is great, might buy some soon once I'm confident about what bitcoin's doing >>9907445
The smart contract has already been deployed. Quick solution my ass. >>9907445
lmao you can't change a smart contract code once it's been deployed. this gook is sneaky! >>9907536
You can easily gook sub 80 IQ twitter followers >>9906078

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA i'm glad i dumped my stack yesterday >he missed the dip >>9907590
you really think that was the bottom? as more people become aware of this bug, they will continue to dump and drive the price down. i honestly think it could reach 25k in a few days. >>9906078
Meh, it's possible to call enableTokenTransfer and transfer in one transaction. It's easy to do >>9907519
Dump will continue until September with consolidation in 2019 and hopefully most shitcoins die
http://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-price-speculation-mt-gox-bitcoin-wont-be-sold-until-september-2018-3

Halving in 2020 which happens every 4 years then new ATH in 2021 with McAfee as president? Look at all the round eyes bad talk superior coin!!! >>9907382
>Western developers/teams like EOS or Ethereum
Eos is a turd from security standpoint. They rushed the launch instead of doing a three month security audit, which they absolutely should do after the remote execution bug was found.
It's very likely eos is going to be successfully attacked in the first few months. >>9906736
It would cost a lot of money in gas. >>9906774
Its how you send commands to the ethereum blockchain. Metamask is a wallet manager/code signer thing thats a browser extension. You use it to run code on a smartcontract. In this case the code will disable the entire smartcontract for everyone until someone else re-enables it. I sold at 2950, it will drop further, won't it? >>9907712

This. How is this even possible? I made a shitcoin once by just copy pasting the tutorial code with a few minor modifications. Im not even a good programmer and im still way better than these guys. >>9907301
Link is a meme, ark is super dead, eng is a scam until proven otherwise. Try EOS or maybe nano once that faggot whale stops dumping.

>you're wrong because I think something is going to happen in the future
That's a pretty weak argument. They've been testing it for months and have put up pretty nice bug bounties.

>>9907736
>spam eos
>network doesn't flinch
>just prove that it can easily do more TPS than Ethereum at maximum capacity
wow nice attack charles >>9907712
Thats the beauty of EOS though. The block producers have the ability to alter blocks via arbitration. If something goes wrong they can just manually fix it. Its basically impossible to permafuck EOS. For instance this ICON bug could simply be patched. >>9907489
permanent solution is mainnet token swap maybe? >>9907490
ETC is a massive shitcoin though. Ethereums only value comes from all the shitcoins it hosts plus Money Skelly. ETC has neither of those. 

The only reason coinbase chose ETC is they can copy paste their ETH code. Its relatively easy to support this coin, same as it was for BCH. >>9907890

Could you guys please explain why you bought this shitcoin in the first place? They are trying to do cross-chain linking right? What made you think this team could do what no team had done before? >>9908413
they looked like smart gooks, they already have one vending machine operating in mainland china and its only accepting ICX tokens! >>9908448
Thats it? A vending machine? >>9908466
Thats more than most other projects have. Obvious orchestrated FUD to take advantage of this bug - genius play. It'll bounce back up to 34k, dump again when BTC shits the bed and the whales will buy back in again at 26k. result. >>9908466
5% of all revenue of vending machines goes to ICX token holders! isn't that great? buy ICX tokens today!
good coin sir >>9907992
>Its a new blockchain buddy. You dont have to do anything, just wait. They scan every address on the contract and pair it up with a new wallet on the new chain.

Sell ICX sir its pajeet coin sir I'm not even confident in the competency of the ICON team but I know how koreans roll and they only fucks with korean shit so that's literally the only reason why I am going to hold ICX lol. Plus Dayli is huge so even if this shit isn't revolutionary or innovative, it will be big in Korea, that's all I know and all I care about. Doesn't look fixed boys. Sell now, buy back in later. 

https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0xb5a5f22694352c15b00323844ad545abb2b11028 I still don't understand why everyone here acts like ICX is the only Korean project. BOS didn't even need to bother with a stupid erc-20 token, they went straight to building their own chain. >>9907032
This. Time and again its revealed how bad developers the asians are and only work on hype. >>9907827
Ah so that's why Nano kept dumping after everything else bounced up. >>9908867
Why buy back lol, people don't learn....don't trust Asians, there's a reason stereotypes exist >>9906078
Ladies ans Gentlemen. 

This is a multi billion dollar project. Please don't worry about the minor bugs and buy more tokens.

Same here dude. Went all in back in December. Fucking worst mistake in my time in crypto . If we get a pump I’m dumping this bullshit. >>9908828
If you know how Koreans roll then why the fuck don’t they buy it.
 We got fucking gooked.

Damn son you got gooked this bug has abolutely nothing to do with mainnet icx which is getting switched to in 4 days >>9909135
You say that, but all erc20 ICX tokens are now effectively trapped. The swap will be fine on exchanges, but there will a large portion lost due to a bug that should’ve been noticed by any amateur dev on day 1. >>9909135
it's not about that. it's about confidence in them as a project. 6 month delay and they can't write code.

i fucking lost everything. fuck. >>9909135
>t. ICX bagholder coper This massive fud is a great sign. Just picked up 6k ICX at .0003. thanks guys guys

How can be a major bug in the codes which are leading into a ERC20 token limbo, called FUD? >>9906078

strongest FUD on strongest project... sell now, subhumans... the propaganda machine doesn't want you rich. that's for calm and collected people like me who aren't swayed by market sentiment... lol "market sentiment"...
i meant:
the retarded BS you subhumans come up with, all day long... >>9909414
what is their fix then? >>9909434
the fact alone that you replied just this fast, if proof that you have an agenda and most likely a huge ICX stack...
thanks.
we're gonna make it :) >>9909449
actually I just woke up, and I had only 300 which I sold at the start of this thread because unlike you I know what technically happens. The fact that you can't state any proof means you are trying to do damage control but you have no understanding of how the technology works.
So again I ask, what is their fix? >>9909414
Stop coping. Not even the bagholders can defend a flawed code.

Btw told you to sell at the seoul conference in the lotto tower right at the moment when the fucking overhyped conferenced wasn't even partially filled. Even the crypto nigger tried to fake hype it with an announcement and then you had pajeets presenting their DAPPs...don't know how many red flags you needed. 

Now below 2 Dollar, i am asking myself how long are you willing to hodl. The mainnet will lead into another drop because they will release more tokens, but who cares. 

We are all coping, buy now. Flawless Code! >>9909479
Everyday I wish I fucking sold. Always sell the news. I was so greedy, hoping it would go back to $12 again when it was around ~9-10 during conference. FML Some crazy fud going on...seems like a good time to finally buy some ICX LOL. Smart contracts are the future guyse! Mass adoption soon. >>9906078
Just bought, thanks, always do opposite of what /biz/ says, guarenteed money >>9909524
There's a difference between fud and legitimate concerns when devs can't find a simple flaw in the contract they "coded" >>9909655
One faggot writes shitty code that means it's definetlly the end of smart contracts. Problem is they didnt fix it.

Just wait for their token swap. It will be caos. >>9906864
This >>9909164
How is it a great sign? >>9907733
>he sold the bottom
Ahahahaaahhaaa >>9909696
I'm trying to find the definition of FUD, nowhere it says that the claim must be false to the statement to be considered FUD.

Like if you recommend product X over product Y by saying that product Y has 1% chance to spontaneously ignite on fire every time it is powered on, and this is a legitimate concern, you ARE indeed spreading FUD.

So calling something FUD is not on argument against anything, it is just stating that "you said something negative about this product", right? >>9910901
Wrong >>9910916
Ye, at least wikipedia said that I was wrong.

>Fear, uncertainty and doubt (often shortened to FUD) is a disinformation strategy

Funny that many explanations omit the disinformation part. >>9910925
At least you can learn from your mistake https://github.com/popldo

DONGok Ryu’s GitHub, the writer of the contract I don't know where to post this, but since /biz/ is where I'm at most of the time, I have figured life.
 Life is about positive and negative. we are currently being trapped in the negative world to feed for the positive world. I read alot of stories about near death experiences where people would die for a few minutes. they all talk about how blissful and peaceful it is, no pain, no negative thought. They always mention an entity convincing them that they have to go back to earth for whatever reason, like a child or family, or a duty they have to finish and they can't tell them what it is.


I truly believe we are living in the negative world so that they can live in the positive world. Because the positive world cannot exist without the negative world.

Life as we know in this world is a game, we are feeding data and negative energy for the positive realm to live off. Hey congrats you reached the top of the pyramid. maybe ur ass is trapped in the negative bro

Im positive as heck. Nothing but love in me, around me, emanating from me. Cheer up OP

Stop giving a heck dude >>9907294
I'm not depressed or anything, but you can't ignore the state of this world >>9907237

Abstinence induced psychosis huh?
Keep on fighting buddy I'm sure you'll get out one day! I have been thinking the same line of thought, however I believe we will enter a positive era after enduring the negative. >>9907237

What if I told you that you could switch between the positive/negative worlds in an instant? Friday night /biz/ posts are the best. 
I too think that we are living in some kind of hell realm. I get that we have the potential to rise up in our own personal lives and create something more beautify....parallel realities if you will. But still, we are doing time here. It's all relative I suppose, but we were born into one of the lower realms of existence. I'd like to think that we're all going to make it some day. Cheers frens >>9907237
Good. Now go read about Taoism, Jung, Christianity and Schrodinger. You are on the path. >>9907237

we are living in a simulation and have to prove ourselves to higher beings. Think of technology and how easy it is in 100 years for some crazy guy to create a virus to kill everyone or build super nuclear bombs or nano bots that turn everyone to Goo. Any advanced civilization will have solved this by removing evil/psychotic members from their civilization. It is more humane to put the evil members into a simulation than to let him/her into technological heaven.

Your body dumps all the DMT it has when you die hence the feelings you hear described by people who have died and 'come back'. My Dad died multiple times in one day and when I asked how it felt he said that the first time is peaceful and relaxing but by the third time he felt no feelings of relaxation at all, it was terrible. And yes he did die shortly after. >>9907237
It’s not quite like that. Earth is what Vedic priests would call a low-middle tier “world”. Each of these levels and worlds that are inhabited by sentient beings are like schools for souls to grow and learn. Higher worlds do not harness the energy of lower worlds for their own betterment — in fact that would be detrimental. Rather, lower dimensional beings are constantly trying to harness energy from those more powerful and in tune than they are. In sum, We are very special but also very troubled.

How do I know this? Let’s just say I experienced a profound meia in which unlocked all truths. Utilize synchronicity and individuate. Also, buy link.

No, you have a negative world, and a positive world. You feel happy and sad. Your sadness compliments your happiness, just like your happiness makes your sadness worse. Life as we know it is a game, but you can choose to not play and take it seriously. Then it's not a game so I guess it's just how you look at it. When you die, nothing happens. But it's okay, because nothing is already happening. Your experience (soul, spirit, etc) is not unique to your human. You are time itself. Anything experiencing change, is experiencing you. Therefore, you cannot necessarily lose your experience, because you are the experience itself. There's no fantasy afterlife. It's just the end of the story for the human you're watching at that moment. As long as other people have developed self awareness in existence, your soul can live on >>9909087
Yo >>9907348
I really don't think it's that bad. We just tend to look at the negative more often because it was beneficial for survival when we evolved

>>9908395
Jesus was not special. When he said he and the father are one and that he is the son of God he wasn't saying he was special. Everyone is one with god and everyone is the son or daughter. You are it

>>9908927
I don't see how that just happened. It doesn't add up. How would our world's be connected? >>9909259
This I cannot explain because I am just a human. But the power elite have been in contact with something very dark for quite some time and permitting it to exist here. By connection I mean we are connected to a single source where our souls/mind have been emitted. Our soul/minds unconsciously traverse where it’s fit best. >>9909296
More plz >>9909296
$? A spirit? Although I don't believe it this seems like an entertaining idea >>9907237
>Life is about positive and negative.
Fucking dichotomous schmuck. Positive and Negative are just relative to different points in your mind - all shit is relative. there is no external reality - shit just 'is'. Meaning and significance only exist in the human mind, a tree doesn't exist, it's simply a cluster of attributes that we have collectively agreed to recognize as a category. It's called phenomenology motherfucker.

This bullshit about a 'negative world' is utterly useless, you still need fucking food in your belly and a roof over your head. I bet that you reading a few near-death experience copypastas on a some-website at 1 am isn't going to instill you with the equanimity to truly dissolve your ego or to find away of making 'heaven on earth' in any meaningful way. The fact that you chose the crypto shitcoin board as the place to post this only shows how truly divorced from reality you have become and the lack of judgement you have: pontificating overly simplistic bullshit to a bunch of materialists who are naturally closed minded to this without attempting to use metaphors or language that might sway them

Fuck you. I can't believe I wasted seconds of my finite time on earth reading this drivel. >>9909087
Interesting.
>>9909423
It's a good thread son, chill the fuck out. Or would you rather read all the pink wojak threads. >>9909323
Research Aleister Crowley in regard to this darkness I’m talking about. Also Saturn worship. Bill Coopers series on this is more than enough so watch his series. As for where and how our souls operate, I cannot provide any information that elucidate this. It’s truly something that can only be fathomed once you, for the lack of a better word, harmonize your mind. Carl Jung, Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance, and Taoism will help understand this. Also listen to Vedic scholars. Really fascinating stuff. >>9909590
Always thought Saturn was just supposed to be limitations of reality? Which I also thought the limit is whatever you say it is, which makes it you. I've seen some weird shit about Saturn cubes online but always thought it was some weird ass religious shit. Still looks like it now desu. I've seen the cube hexagon shit and flower of life though during drugs I think it's all just my self though for real. Could the darkness be fake though? I've been thanking that the god of the bible is nonexistence, or death. Fear god, no real image of it, etc. But in the end you find it's all a big bluff or a joke, because everything is already nothing, or the paradox of it not existing. Also this has led me to believe this is all somehow nonexistent. Don't know if any of that makes sense to you. I'll have to check that out though I've dabbled in crowley and Hinduism before >>9907237
welcome brudda >>9908395

I like to believe in freedom, though I know this is probably necessary. So many tail risks.

Though we're not there yet, the greatest risk to humanity is still mother nature and not each other. Megavolcanoes, quasars, rogue black holes, electric universe discharge. So we need to work together to get to the next level to where we start worrying about each other more. What's it like being a schizotypal crypto investor? >>9908847
Not necessarily. There are many cases of people seeing hell during brain death. Your DMT theory falls flat on it's arse, boi. Spread your boipucci. Shake it for some LINK. >>9909747
The cube symbolizes many things but it’s ultimately a symbol for the mind. Now this symbol is not inherently bad or good, it’s just what it is. However, because the power elite worship the intellect on a material level there is an ominous connotation. What you said is perfectly in line for what it represents. 

Remember this: as above so below. If there is goodness, there is darkness. There is stupid amount of evidence unveiling this but cognitive dissonance has scrambled many people from truly knowing it exists. I’ve experienced it and I never want to again. Genesis and New Testament gods are very different. Genesis delineates that man is maliciously controlled by god; Jesus on the other hand heralded that everyone is one with this force and are children of it. It’s tricky stuff, all of this. this nigger gone wack he far he far >>9907237
but im making so much money off of shorting. im pretty sure this is the positive world. >>9909971
i think he means as a whole, like the number of people who have it worse are way more than the number of people who have it good.

And by worse i mean waking up starving to go look for a drop of water kind of worse >>9909959
Jews muslims n other shits use cube as a very important image. It's the image of the old closed minded primitive religions. Christianitys symbol is an opened cube - a cross. An enlightenment can be reached through the teachings of Jesus. Genesis is probably the only book in the old testament that seems to be from true GOD, one who is also Jesus.

Old testament is made up of YHWH being evil, only loving jews, being a tyrant who wants people to worship him, as if he's insecure and has no power. Most of the old testament was made up of Satans teachings who came up to people in angelic forms. Satan is known for his ability to transform. He's trying to vilify GOD, turn him into a genocidal, xenophobic baby killing maniac when GOD is good judging from the creation story. Also in Genesis God is referred to as trinity. Even in torah. Even though jews go against Christ. Also some interesting thoughts: Man was created in GODs image. GOD exists beyond matter, time and space. Jesus always existed and man was made in Jesus image. He had to go to heaven in order for a human sample to be in place during the creation. Jesus was an answer of GOD to people following false religions. Including judaism, to which Jesus refers to as synagogue of SATAN. Be careful with this shit boys. A bunch of sheep shagging shepherds in the desert could not have ever come up with this story on their own. >>9910070
Sorry I meant Old Testament. But yeah, I understand and know all about what you explained. It’s surreal. Jesus in my opinion is the most important figure of enlightenment because of our ongoing struggle with our dreidel foes. >>9907466

Volume is pretty big and price is slightly dropping. Bearish short term, especially with BTC that’s going to retrace at 4-5k, scoop some at 1.2-1.4~ dollaroos desu >>9911527
congrats on being a retard, not accounting 
for mainnet swap in 4 days OR the bug in the code, try again ICON != shitcoin. I mean ICON == shitcoin. It'll dump then pump in a month or 2
Icx still needs to create a new smartcontract and issue new tokens >>9911540
LOL xD >>9911531
yeah, token swap will SURELY pump this gook coin >>9911562
Into oblivion with the release of fresh tokens >>9911531
Since when does a mainnet pump a coin you autistic fuck, this shit is gonna drop like a rock once BTC hits the fan >>9911581
since it gives it function u moron, other coins dont actually do anything on their mainnet thats why they dump when it happens >>9911677
lmao screencapped
i'll post it when the price dumps below 20k on the 20th. >>9911694
ok and what happens if it goes up, you just gonna freeroll it? >>9911703
i will still post the screencap and admit that i was wrong >>9911581
People will see then how fast the network is, and how easy to use it is.

And let me tell you, it is fast. >>9911703
Your mainnet pre pump was destroyed by terrible coding. Now on top of the classic mainnet dump you will get dumped with fresh coins. Get fucked in every single hole >>9911711
fair enough, fwiw I have made about 50ish transactions on mainnet icx and its instantaneous with fixed 0.01 fee, it works great, thats why im saying if it works like that once all the volume is switched on it, it has to pump. Will that happen or not I dont know, I believe its a good chance so I hold 250k icx >>9911703
don't forget the presale airdropped tokens will unlock on the 20th. what do you think those people who have had those tokens locked for 6 months will do? most of them have already moved on and they'll just dump the free coins when they get the chance. >>9911715
only thing u forgot is that the majority of the fresh coins have already been sold. If they fuck up something its gonna dump of course but has nothing to do with a bit of extra supply. >>9911727
Im probably closer to those airdrop holders in mindset since I have 250k icx since presale and I sold maybe 20k until now, so I doubt that ICO holders are desperate to sell 2% extra >>9911724
You forgot to sell your tokens at 7-12$ and afterwards averaged down...poor bagholder >>9911750
I didnt since mainnet tokens werent tradable when erc20 icx was 11$, but otherwise you would have a point whales aren't selling means only one thing. they're waiting for mainnet to sell their airdropped stacks and buy back in lower >>9911761
whales didnt get airdrop 2%, since it only went to ico buyers and they arent whales with 75k icx cap. Whales have the strategic allocation pool, most of which was mainnet tokens, no one knows the exact number but approx 10-14% new supply. That being said a lot of it was sold already through private channels Roll a "cha"

Assuming it will recover which I don't think it will. had a guaranteed 50% in one month, would you take it, or would you turn it down in order to gamble on shitcoins that could go "10x"? I would gamble.. 50% you can do with a pump and dump on shitcoins..

>In one notable episode, Dexter faked his own death to see how people would react. About 3,000 people attended Dexter's mock wake. Dexter did not see his wife cry, and after he revealed the hoax, he caned her for not grieving his death sufficiently. 50% citation needed and 50% one source called "The World's Greatest Cranks and Crackpots".

Most famously, in imitation of the King of England, Dexter hired his own poet laureate -- a hapless 20 year-old who he’d found in the market, selling halibut from a wheelbarrow.

BNB is going non stop and will continue to go up in 2018, OLD ATH BROKEN TODAY
BIX did like 2x in one month
FCoin did 50x or so

1. Coinbene (chink exchange) will add an exchange token soon. You know FCoin, literally lol @ not throwing some money on it


2. Most of you probably missed FCoin. BKEX is maybe the next 10x gook exchange token.


 - According to the telegram 200k chinks already submitted kyc in first 15 min
 - Holders will get 100% daily dividends (FCoin gave out 80%)
 
 Anyway idk if you value your privacy, but you get 4000 Bkex when you sign up under a referral and complete a kyc (1. Front ID pick, pick of backside of ID, Facepic with a paper saying "bkex.com + date"). 

Their telegram if you have further questions: https://t()me/bkex_service_english, whitepaper is in there too.

going to throw 500 bucks in there too hoping it will do a FCoin.

Sign up with my ref desu ngl: https://www.bkex.com/#/register/H0ohGs0o 
Yall get 1000 bkex for every ref you can get btw So, I did the research and this is what I found:
The two co-founders are top tier autists from Cornell and Harvard.
The actual founder is at this point anonymous, just like Satoshi. 
If you know who he is, please drop it ITT.
It isn't a ponzi, scam, or any of that fud because the contract is locked and it was announced the same day it was created. 
The developers have just as much control over the project as anyone else. 
The distribution is possibly the most fair coin dist in the history of crypto.
There was no ICO, no marketing team, just a completely good intentioned and fair project. 
Its a community driven marketing team.
Infernal Toast, tho he may be completely anonymous, is highly active in the discord and he will actually talk to you. 
He's also a pretty cool guy. 
The Lava wallet that Infernal Toast put together is going to change the way all ERC20 tokens are sent - this is not up for debate. dyor
There is extremely healthy movement on the charts and its clearly not a pnd. 

From the looks of this whole thing, it clearly has a buy rating. 
The greedy fags on biz dont want you in on this one for sure. Thats why theres so much fud. infernal toast is a shitskin scammer, that's why he doesn't show his face
the two guys in your pic have had no internet presence save for 10 years old pics here and there, and nobody has ever seen them at any blockchain event, how convenient
there's no point to 0xbtc, distribution through pow is by definition unfair as it rewards early adopters disproportionately >>9911566

Infernal_toast is satoshi. He's come back to save us >>9911592 In the past one man could feed a whole family.

Now even though technology has advanced, life has become shit.

Instead of working fewer hours, spending lots of time with wifey and friends, cooking and living healthy, you chose a lonely life, full of stress, working 60 hours per week, eating and living unhealthy and therefor developping health problems, no time for family and friends, so you can buy an fucking overprized house and all kind of useless stuff.

Seriously are most of you fucking retarded? What is with you? There is one life and you live it for the jews. UUUUhh but I need my 50000 thousands different candies that will kill me, uuhuhhhhh I need to buy a rolex. 

Seriously everyone of you should kill himself, because your life isnt worth living, you are just a dead man trapped in a human body. this is exactly the problem bitcoin solves >>9911380

What are we supposed to do then? Where are you supposed to live? Houses and apartments are super expensive now. >>9911380
B-but muh bills >>9911388
Honestly I have no fucking clue. 95% of people are completely delusional and are completely controlled by the jews. Life could be so beautiful but you retards make life hell. >>9911394

No I am currently a NEET.

I would love to work 4 hours a day, having a wife that also works 4 hours a day, and being able to afford a small home and a car. 
I will not work 8 hours a day to live in a shoebox full of mold, before that happens I will go on a suicide murder spree and kill everyone in my way: children, women, men. lowkey commie thread >>9911478
I was talking with OP but ok... Humans make this life shitty, so you make it so too because you are a human.

Humans are fearful pathetic creatures, they fear that everything will be taken away from them, so they take from others. When you rid yourself of all those fears, only then you are free.

No one really wants that but fancier chains. >>9911380

If I knew I could get away with it, I would come home to and stab you death >>9911380
You are right. Neighborhoods barely exist anymore. Women were conned into trading motherhood for office jobs and are increasingly unhappy about it. Job market saturation ensures stagnant wage growth. The "eyes" are in retirement homes. No one knows let alone trusts anyone in their own block. They're too busy working, too tired and burnt out to engage with anyone around them. It doesnt help that everyone is pissed and stressed about their shitty lives. Im convinced this is why people are acting out so aggressively. Why is everyone an asshole now? They are slaves - stuck - unaware, with not a clue how to break free. Look at how people drive. Do they really want to be assholes, or are they running late? Well, I've officially lost six figures thanks to this piece of shit. I guess I'll legit kms at this point. What do you mean "lost"? Are you selling? >>9911296

Sounds like a beautiful haiku It's Saturday morning in America. Last night we got hammered like we do every Friday. Nothing like letting go on the weekend to forget about how shitty your life is.

Our paychecks won't go through the bank until Monday so we also aren't buying.  >>9911055

>9910464 (OP)
>You have to use a specific BTC ATM
Isn't there an option like you get somekind of debit card which is connected to your btc balance. You can use this card to pay for services and goods. The card provider converts btc to currency in which the services or good is priced. Also, can't such card be used to withdraw cash from atm? >>9910538
does that 40% go to the tax center? >>9910558
There is one prepaid card BTC still around. 1500 max without verificiation, but who knows for how long it is still out there >>9910574

Sucks to be you m8 I work closely with the maintainers of GO lang (the language chainlink is written in) in Google. I 'm thinking for the lulz to start opening pull requests at chianlink's repos, helping them out. Not developing features or fixing bugs, but doing code reviews, helping them structure things better etc.

Do you think that would affect the price and be presented as google endorsing them? (I really don't want that, and I don't want my employer involved in any case. I only want to help them achieve their vision for the fun of it).

Also, are there other promising cryptocurrency projects written in GO? I am new to the space and only know of link. Thanks biz! >>9908664
If this isn't a larp, my answer would be no, the price would not be affected. >>9908664
> t. desperate linkie >>9908672

It is not. And I actually, I think I will just use a new github account not associated with any of my current work, and my name won't be on it. That should be good enough I think. >>9908664
die pajeet die >>9908664

fuck off So, on to my next question. Any other crypto projects relying on GO? (I want to help other teams with the same, as long as they don't appear scammy, in it for just a quick exit but actually want to create meaningful work that might have a small chance of impacting the world for the better) >>9908664
I doubt the google connection would move the price, but if, during your testing, you made some kind of discovery you could share...

There are lulz to be had, for sure >>9908664
If you can contribute to the repo do it. Its your chance to be immortalised in meme history. >>9908695

DAILY REMINDER:

FOOT FETISHISM HAS BEEN LINKED TO LATENT HOMOSEXUALITY IN NUMEROUS STUDIES.

MEN WITH FOOT FETISHES ARE QUITE LITERALLY HOMOSEXUALS IN THE CLOSET.

THEY CRAVE PHALLIC OBJECTS DOMINATING THEM SYMBOLICALLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE SEVERE MUMMY ISSUES EMBEDDED DEEP WITHIN THEIR PSYCHE. IT IS LITERALLY FROM CHILDHOOD TRAUMA.

FEET HAVE BEEN A SYMBOL OF SUBMISSION FOR MILLENNIA.

THERE IS A REASON (((THEY))) PROMOTE FOOT FETISHISM SO MUCH. BECAUSE IT IS THE GATEWAY FETISH... FIRST YOU START WITH FOOT FETISH PORN, THEN YOU'RE A KEKOLD, THEN YOU'RE A TRANNY GAY FAGGOT, UNIRONOCALLY TOO. YOU CAN SEE THE RELATED VIDEOS ON PORNHUB AND ITS TRUE. OR THE "OTHERS ALSO WATCHED" SECTION.

THEY ALSO PROMOTE IT BECAUSE WHEN MARKETING THEY CAN TAP INTO YOUR "PASSIONS" BY INCLUDING CERTAIN IMAGERY ON SCREEN AND SINCE TITS AND VAG ARE BANNED, THEY CAN USE A FOOT TO REPLACE WITH THE SAME EFFECT. SEE: THE SPRITE COMMERCIAL FEATURING AMERICAN RAPPER 2 CHAINS WITH HAS KEKOLDRY, FOOT FETISHISM, ETC, ALL IN ONE WHILE SELLING A PRODUCT. >>9910499
I'm okay with this >>9910499
cope >>9910499
So what? I can't care less as long as it's latent. And even if it will stop be, whatever. 
>>9910532
Perfection >>9910499
Well most people with foot fetish are into other submissive fetishes. And what is the ultimate submission for a man ? To give up his masculinity and his desire to have sex with women, so it doesn't surprise me if foot fetishism is linked with becoming a cuckold sissy. >>9910569
You might find this interesting. Great business-related thread you've got going here faggot OP. >>9910601

Either gonna make it or an hero

Was a good run boys >>9910664
I hope this is true and that you win. how much do you stand to win/lose? >>9910664
Anon, this is why you make bad investments and lose your money.

You just gamble. You don't research, you don't think. You just go all in, and with a bad sense of intuition.

Argentina always wins the first round against lesser powered countries. They have too many great individual players to not surpass an inferior team.

It's up in the tournament that they drop, when they face other good teams that force them to be an actually coordinated team, rather than a sum of individual talents. That's why Argentina can no longer beat Brazil, Germany, etc.

But Iceland? You're just pajeeting yourself betting on the lowest probability. post like this are are signal that it's time to buy Does being suicidal make you better at trading Just buy MOT and live your life >>9910865

Oh go fuck urself anon;) went thru china from the north (yabuli, near NK all the way down to vietnam. 2 months. Its amazing country, people r awsome yet still it is a techno-communist dictatorship.. I can't wait to live in world where China is the premier superpower China is one of the few countries we're the public leaders are actually in control instead of just puppets. 
It's also a form representative democracy but without parties. The voting is intra party and everyone can join the party.
It has consistently higher population approval than any big western country, so the end result is more democracy effectively.

I remember disgusting boomers shilling the idea that putin was also a dictator despite 70% plus approval rating and open elections.

Its our own governments that aren't for the people and aren't following the will of the people. Sad that we're effectively less democratic than those meme countries but true nonetheless. >>9911067
Russia basically has 1 party and the entire media is controlled by the state. I'm not saying the US media is perfect, but they do criticize policians and different organizations show different opinions. This is literally not true in Russia. You have the public always being influenced by a propagandizing media for Putin, and where any outside party is heavily criticized. It's very easy to get a much higher than 70% approval rating when the only thing you are even informed about, when it concerns politics, is one party's achievements. It is not democratic unless you believe a democracy is valid when most of the public is brainwashed. I'm sure North Korea also has over a 70% approval rating. >>9911116

kind of a hassle to make ethereum into one though. they better do it sooner or later however because the quantum computing race is likely farther ahead in secret research labs than it is for private companies developing commercially and openly.

how do you voluntarily sterilize yourself? >>9904645 Hi stock friends.

I'm not much of an investor. Work for Uncle Sam in securing imaginary lines on maps.

I hear tell of an effort between Maersk shipping and IBM to invest heavily in block chain for global trade. My agency is pretty much in the bag for it, think it will be yuge down the road. I'd rather invest in crypto, but it's more of a platform than a branded coin. 

Thinking about just investing in IBM and Maersk. Any suggestions/thoughts, experts? >>9904645
Yes that’s the point, you swing trade them not hodl. You buy them, hope something bad happens to the market, and then hopefully sell them for a profit the next day. Pretty sure you can use them to hedge on volatility, but I’m a brainlet so I don’t do that. >>9904615
I know that feel too

But I am a bit more optimistic (delusional ?)

AMRS may well be on the path to commercialize the next gen sweetener in Q318
That may be the near term catalyst

Also, market is still ignoring AMRS's guidance and is pricing it like before. If Melo continues to deliver on his promises, the market may give it a higher ratio (remember, P/Sales is only 1.5 the guidance)

Right now, I am worried about the trucker strikes in Brazil. I wonder how that impacted AMRS's supply in sugarcane. >>9904635

Do they work for the government? VZ working on 5G pro tip Buy SVRA.

Even conservative estimates have it at mid-20s, which considering it's 14 dollars that's over 100%. And you can rely on a obscenely bullish $40 dollar call from Evercore to push the stock up more and more.

IT might even see 40, too, if the news from their June 20 exhibition is that good. >>9904865

There isnt going to be another 10% correction, you had your chance in february, and now its gone >>9904716

Fair question. All along the supply chain are delays and inefficiencies based off historical practice not logic. From supplier to consumer, there are contracts, bonds, transport costs etc which could all be seamless, paperless, and painless with block chain. I agree with their thoughts on this.

>how come getting into stocks is so much harder than crypto?
Crypto is only easy because it's all a ponzi scheme, a literal guessing game of when you can get in and get out before the coming exit scam. Use google and investopedia and stop being lazy. Expect to take some losses in the beginning because you actually have to use your brain, unlike crypto. >>9905045

>Giving you's to a troll >>9904514
as a proud 5% shareholder of UVXY inc, my suggestion may come with somewhat of a bias, but i can assure you that it is nonetheless, very sound.

you see a lot of "low IQ" or "hihg IQ" shitposting around here. and thats all well and good for when times are good. but when times are tough, high IQ will not save you.
only HIGH TEST can save you.

thats where UVXY comes in.
you see, UVXY inc is the major player in the fear commoditization business. we thrive while others are suffering.

and the reason?
our fearless leader, CEO mike tyson is back in charge.

take a look at that chart. you see way back when? that was UVXYs IPO. $1M per share. that peak? when mike had to step down. the most recent run? mikes return to the market.

dont you see? its the most undervalued company in the world. tensions are high, fear is in the air, and the worlds leader in the fear sector is sitting at 99.9% down over the last few years.

its the most obvious buy in all of wallstreet.
BUY it and NEVER sell >>9905146
how am i trolling retarded anime poster. i dont understand how someone could get into stocks when opposite to crypto which the only thing you need to do is have one exchange which has all the coins you need to make money and coinmarketcap is an entire archive of all the coins there are on the market

the reason its confusing to you is that its completely different

crypto is like a hybrid between weird OTC stocks, and forex. dont be surprised when absolutely none of the things you "know" from crypto are dangerously inapplicable.

to learn, read books. read investopedia. take a small amount and try your hand at it. there are more things that affect stocks prices, more things that support them, more utilities to trade them with and a number of other things you dont have. its also far bigger than the crypto market. and theres a LOT more moving pieces.

just read books >>9905178

Pls don't reveal sekrit identity blahhaha >>9905045
You want to see a list of every single stock on the entire exchange? Why? Use market scanners or trade companies or industries that you know a lot about. 

It's not like coins where you buy a couple and expect them to moon and take over the entire market which is the retarded game that crypto plays. In the stock market it doesnt matter If a stock goes up, down, or sideways, you can make money on any and all movement if you can predict it or guess correctly. You could just trade a single stock your whole life and get massive gains on it without that stock growing or falling much at all. That's the beauty of it. 

You're asking and somewhat raging doe someone to explain the stock market to you in a post on 4chan. No one is gonna spoonfeed you and judging by your attitude your probably not bright enough to be a successful trader so maybe you wanna go back to crypto threads and fomo-ing all your neetbucks away >>9904824

It's a ridiculously good deal and you don't even have to have a down payment.  I wouldn't be investing in any stocks right now. Whether you are well read investor or not.

look for things that are undervalued/down for no reason or with some bullish catalyst. buy some. dont go all in. when/if it goes down more, buy more and average down. hold it. when it looks like its reversing, sell some, buy back when it gets lower. repeat.

Agreed. The thing about the bart is that there is no consensus on what it means, if anything, aside from a failed p&d. Only action I take with barts is a stop loss about halfway up the green candle in similar way I would stop loss a rising stair case pattern or a bull flag. >>9907654

damn What do you guys think about the future of nuclear energy / power plants? I wanna invest in some companies cause I'm really behind nuclear, but I think the situation in the US is kinda shitty, I read plants don't get enough government funding to build em properly.
Plus the general public seems to want solar / wind energy more than anything, but I don't really think it's going anywhere, or will ever put out significant amounts of energy to warrant widespread general use. 
So I'm a little conflicted. Anyone have any thoughts? >>9907822
I've tried my best to steer everyone away despite my heavy bags. >>9907977
some anons are in LTBR for that, but it's pretty pointless until more reactors are approved. it's been decades since that happened?

Delisted by Christmas. >>9907977
>I read plants don't get enough government funding to build em properly.
its mostly just noise put out by the environmentalist crowd desu. nuclear is pretty goddamned safe as far as almost any energy shit goes. and infinitely more efficient than wind, solar etc as it never turns off (tho solar would be better if we didnt have that pesky atmosphere in the way).

though we should really be doing small scale thorium reactors to power towns and cities one at a time. much less dangerous fuel and waste. the reason we dont is because the waste product is useful in the construction of nuclear warheads. and also because it would solve fucking everything energy wise and put countless amounts of people and industries out of business. in particular oil.

but dont take most media noise about nuclear energy at face value desu. this sounds like a whole lot of "my dad works at nintendo", but my pops was a nuclear physicist. things arent nearly as crude now as they would like to have you believe. even while considering the waste product (which like i said are then purified into plutonium, and thats the REAL hot part) its still the cleanest energy we got. the waste that is created is nasty stuff, but its not impossible to deal with.

the problem comes from building these older style facilities on fucking fault lines and on islands where theres earthquakes and tsunamis all the fucking time. they should be building thorium but the media has everyone trained to freak out at the mention of "nuclear" and they shut off their ears. and like anon said >>9908063 no poli is gonna stick their neck out. theyd get whacked by the oil money, the environmental cartel AND their own voters at the same time

fusion is the one we want, but like i said, these old fission reactors are useful in the manufacturing of nuclear weapons and (surprise) its only DARPA and black funds that go to nuclear facilities >>9907977
nuclear power is not currently profitable and there is a lot of research that still needs to be done. if it can be solved though, it will make every alternative obsolete. Investing in fusion is kinda redundant imo. if we ever get it, then it will pretty much solve everybodys basic needs. investing in it is kinda like betting your friend $100 that you will win the lottery next week. >>9908204
fusion (which is what my pops was working on) is not something you CAN invest in. fusion research is so unfathomably expensive (and were still in the "line up whatever particle and blast it with as much as we got and take pictures" phase). i know the one out in los alamos costs something like $10M a shot. lol, and not all of those shots yield data thats actually readable as sometimes the laser will peak out all the cameras, or theyll fucking miss the atom theyre trying to annihilate. were likely to be in the LOLWTFRWEDOING phase for the next 100 years at least. and it will be horrifically unprofitable until, like you said, absolutely everything will be solved and it wont matter cuz we literally star trak warpcore ma niggas >>9908204
i wish i had my old comp. i had an awesome paper i found on how to make nuclear profitable via thorium. for whatever reason, knowledge on thorium reactors is incredibly suppressed, sometimes twisted maliciously, and the people who study it are criminally underfunded (by design. science is almost worse than politics in this regard).

but thorium would be such a smaller risk to deal with on a day to day, youd save a ton of the overhead that youd normally need to constantly monitor and protect the facility. the initial cost would be higher, as they are smaller and youd need a lot of them, but the cocksuckers have made it impossible to even try and build a couple to test it out (which again leads me to believe there is some sort of political pressure going on behind the scenes ala what happened to tesla) >>9908314
i don't put too much stock in conspiracy theories, if it was really that easy there would be more outcry.
from what I've heard the corrosion from LFTRs is incredibly high meaning they can't sustain the reaction for long times without destroying the container what are my IQ bros buying when this gets to a target of +100? a new car or maybe a house? what memes to study over the weekend? >>9908345
lol its not a conspiracy theory. im telling you ive been talking to my dad about this shit for my entire life. hes worked on it for twice as long as ive been alive. hes certainly not the only nuclear geek ive talked to either that thinks theres something else going on.

>if it was really that easy there would be more outcry.
no there wouldnt, because people hear nuclear and they shudder and start kvetching about fukushima like that wasnt a fucking retarded idea on the japs part in the first place. thorium has literally no chance of meltdown in the traditional sense. it will simply destroy itself and be useless if unmaintained. 

>from what I've heard the corrosion from LFTRs is incredibly high meaning they can't sustain the reaction for long times without destroying the container
we need to build some and test them out. sooner the better. and oddly enough, this is exactly what the people whove been studying them for years now have been begging for. and theyre still waitin... >>9908314
>Falling for the thorium meme
Thorium is one of the most overshilled nothingburgers of the last decade. Basically any advantage thorium shills claim has to do with the molten salt reactor design, not thorium itself. You could run the same process with uranium salts and get the same benefit. Thorium shills like to conflate the two and imply the advantages come from the material itself.

It's true that reactor design funding was cut in the 60s/70s, but this has been massively overblown. Like all it was was a proof of concept experiment that went nowhere, and people act like it's some huge coverup. It wasn't even possible to build the reactor design at scale back then. The alloys needed to withstand the reactor conditions didn't exist.

Nuclear power in general is DOA right now because the capex per unit energy is an order of magnitude or more above other power sources, while also taking years longer to finish construction and reach operation. It doesn't make sense from an investment standpoint. Pretty much the only way to do nuclear is the way China is doing it, where you pick a standard reaction design, have the government subsidize the shit out of it, and mass produce reactors of the same design. >>9908393
all im saying is that if we are talking about having clean energy, its definitely one of the best. wind is garbage. solar is getting there but useless to most places. thorium reactors would be a very helpful piece to fill in the gaps. and f we already arent running a profit on traditional reactors, whats the difference? >>9908393
fact is, its horrendously understudied, and the reason is that tradition fission reactors produce materials that are very much coveted by DARPA I'm pro-nuclear. My grandfather worked at a plant in Kentucky that manufactured requisite materials for reactors. I didn't really talk to him about it much until I was older, in my 20s, and he basically laid it out about how it's mostly hysteria against nuclear power. I hate week-ends what stocks can be daytraded on weekends? >>9908378

Its tiering your risk tolerance and needs. Mine will be the example. 
25% Low risk; Vanguards
30% Low/Mid risk; dividend carriers
35% Mid/High risk; Personal stock picks that are not crazy
10% High Risk; Pharmaceutical companies, long shots, straight gambling. 

A reasonable person who was careful would be more along the lines of 
45% Low
30% Low/Mid
20% Mid/High
5% High

All of this assumes you know how to use limits and you don't buy low sell high like a tard. Words of advice, don't start with more than 1k if you are new to the rodeo. Learn your shit and play with a weeks wages. Learn to cut losses and avoid FOMO. You don't stay on a sinking ship without a plan.

Don't die plz. How long do you have? so i just realized that trading view allows for spread charts on futures contracts (and everything else too). does anyone have any experience in using spread charts in predicting future moves (via the same underlying, diff expiry) or judging sector/index rollovers. im also interested in utilizing this in analyzing bonds. i know damn well all the smart kids know how to divide, and are using this shit to figure out timeframes (which is my weakpoint desu). i wanna be a smart kid too.

if anyone knows any books or videos related to such things, gimme a (you)

>>9909115
the people who only buy OTM contracts are retarded.
ITM is the best way to make 20% gains fucking VERY consistently (provided you know what youre doing and use stops/hedge in some way). and you dont have to stop at that either. still quite easy to make more (like what i did on SLV 170% and EEM 65% today). but people want dem 1000% gains. they just dont realize you need to save those OTM ones for the rainy days when the bogs are running wild >>9905743
your pic is funny because it is exactly how I imagine Comfy to be >>9909631
Comfer do you read Deleuze & Guattari? What about Fanged Noumena? well i guess im just gonna do this instead of sleep

check out this chart.
decided to check the spread of the five year yield vs the two year yield. was looking through the history of it and found one day in particular where it moved very quickly. turns out that day was just about 4 months before the dotcom bubble crashed.

is that wild or what?
them bond traders are smart puppies desu >>9909645
I am not Comfy senpai >>9909842
I have a small and deficient brain
I have been thiking hard about the yield inversion and try to figure out why investors would buy longer duration bonds with a lower yield and sell shorter-term bond with a higher yield.

This is the answers I came up with:
- they think longer term yields are going to decrease even more (which makes sense in the case of a recession, the FED would slash its interest rates and print money)
- they overall payout of the low yield/long term bonds is superior to the oe of high yield/short term bonds

Also, as to why it is an indicator of a recession, I think it gives a snapshot of the overall liquidity of the companies. It makes sense that shtf several months later (the following earning season ?) because we begin to see defaults from companies that failed to get fresh cash months before. >>9909847

Where are you supposed to find those new ones with potential? >>9909896
lol yea you got it. thats exactly the theory behind the predictive power of the yield curve inverting. though you have it backwards kinda (yield goin UP means bond price moves DOWN). thats why the curve being as flat as it is makes big money nervous (hence why theyre mooning china rn and not us so much anymore).

heres another one of the 5yr yield vs the 2yr yield.
i mapped out important days where the market moved significantly. left to right (in terms of the meme bubble graph) its:
>green: NEW PARADIGM!!!
>yellow: denial
>pink range: bulltrap to return to normal
>red: fear and capitulation
>last green: despair (you win the game if you buy here)

im going to keep fucking around with these spread charts, for sure. im noticing little patterns in older big moves. perhaps ill be able to figure out how to apply it >>9908381

just start reading random 10-K's >>9910071
Nice (are you teh penis ?)

Where do you think we are now ? >>9910183
yea

and i dunno, i just started playing around with these spread charts. not even sure if im doin it right desu
but it seems that times when the spread itself is really volatile are ugly times. when the spreadis increasing, it is sideways to bearish times, and when they form a downtrend, its bullish times (this is in relation to SPY).

however i know that the spread getting really small is bad, and if it inverts, were doomed. but were just flat right now. so id assume thats where were at, with the curve very flat because rates were low, yields were low and weve been bullish for a long time. now the FED is trying to carefully raise rates because SOMEONES gotta hold our fucking debt and they aint gonna do it with negative yields.

the chart as of now looks like the spread is increasing, which id assume is good for our overall market (as we dont want it to invert), but may put a damper on the party. not gonna be another 2017 thats for sure heres a cool one. looks like were supposed to long the fuck out of oil right now. this is a chart of the difference in price between the july crude oil futures and the december crude oil futures. this sudden moonshot of the spread is (i think) giving us a very clear buy signal >>9910329
uncertainty about production cuts? OPEC meets Jul 22 iirc. >>9910265
I am the same fag talking about Trump and the FED's objective to deleverage softly the economy

Every smart guy is looking at this yield curve to try to time the recession... which means you won't see the recession coming here. 

A crisis always come from uncharted territories, and I believe it will come from Europe, from a purely political cause. Namely a key country like Italy abandoning EUR, defaulting on its EUR debts, crashing the Euro banks and marging calling everyone else.

Still on the USO gamle lol ?
It makes sense because USD has been soaring and investors are now taking the opposite bet : USD weakening later in the year since the yield curve remains flat.

That would mean oil will moon. >>9910383
ive been saying the same thing for weeks now. everyones saying im retarded. but then i keep finding out others are doing the same shit

>>9910393
i was more looking at 08 just to understand the mechanics more clearly. it was easy to find those dates. i cant be more clear about the fact that i dont know what im doing here and am just scribbling lines and trying things rn.

>FED's objective to deleverage softly the economy
thats what i was saying. theyre not gonna let it invert. if things go well, the spread will widen, and if its gradual enough, were all gonna make it.

>A crisis always come from uncharted territories, and I believe it will come from Europe, from a purely political cause. Namely a key country like Italy abandoning EUR, defaulting on its EUR debts, crashing the Euro banks and marging calling everyone else.
lol then we are on the EXACT same page, fren

>were you the guy talking about DNR?
Nope
I don't do macro trade and I don't do oil companies >>9910465
lol i guess im a wannabe macro guy. this stuff makes a lot more sense to me for some reason.
i wanna see if i can incorporate this into estimating bonds prices, as thats where ive been making my lunch money lately (theyve been VERY volatile recently. moreso than the indexes even). but if i could double check this every day (and if it proves reliable), im almost certain i could dramatically increase my percentage of wins, which with options, would mean like double the returns. >>9910500
I like macro but trading it is speculation imo and I don't speculate (and I also don't trade in general)
I wish I can one day ride on Buffett-sama's shoulders. I am learning to invest.

From what I am reading, I don't think US Treasuries are in a clear bear trend. With all the shit happening rn, they would make for a desirable safe haven. >>9910561
ive just been noticing the FEDs carpet bombing long term bonds lately. my guess is to try and normalize the curve somewhat, in addition to their usual duties of simply controlling the money. ive mostly been long on them this last month or so. but now with the 4th hike almost CERTAIN, im expecting another big down leg at some point. >>9910589
>4th hike almost CERTAIN
If it is almost certain, it is already priced in

What you must look at are data related to inflation (like core CPI, hourly wages, NFP). Any hint of inflation going higher will make the FED even more hawkish than previously thought.

What is funny about the FED carpet bombing the LT bonds is despite them dumping the LT bonds (and buying ST ones), yield curve refuses to steepen. What to make of it ? Investors are afraid ? Does anyone here trade bonds? >>9910637
>If it is almost certain, it is already priced in
i dont buy it. they just barely announced it, and bonds were pumped to high hell. they at the very least should be down from where they are, if not another dramatic leg down.

>like core CPI, hourly wages, NFP
thats what i have been watching desu
just tryin to mix this in there somewhere now too, see if it helps

>What is funny about the FED carpet bombing the LT bonds is despite them dumping the LT bonds (and buying ST ones), yield curve refuses to steepen. What to make of it ? Investors are afraid ?
hey hey i called that one (pic related)
but i think yields coming back at all is a big thing. no one wanted them before when ALL they had was downside. theres something at least now. 
another thing could just be people being scared.
the third thesis is that, given the "unique" circumstances for the last decade, that the FED is trying to do something that their computer models arent able to accurately predict, and they dont have a clue what theyre doing (as this shit has never happened before, so the historical data might mean piss all).
