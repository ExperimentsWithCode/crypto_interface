# Crypto Interface

## Goal:
* Track mentions on 4Chan, Reddit Comments, Reddit Posts
* a lot of other cool shit
* Add more base pairs

# Currently:
* Can hardcode portfolio pairs and view current USD value from converting through ETH.
* Can view load currency info
* Can load ETH price

* Can update current 4Chan threads. This will not overwrite previously stored data, and will not double counts

* Can display current 4Chan mention counts.
